I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
It's hard to look right at you, baby
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe
You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
And you should know that
So call me maybe
New York, tell me how you feel about it
We just met, yeah, we just met
LA, ask me for the truth about it
We just met, and I wish we could be holding hands
How do you think it goes with those tiny little bows?
You're the one I want, you're the one I know
And everywhere you are is a place I want to go
Dancing really high, dancing really slow
Paris, do you ever think about us?
Watching TV in your bed
Hey London, call me if you think about it
Don't forget, I wish we could be holding hands
I wish we could be holding hands
Cupid, draw back your bow
And let your arrow go straight to a lover's heart
I went out last night
I'm going out tonight again
Anything to capture your attention
And she's a real sweet girl
And you know I got a boy
Details we both forgot to mention
I always know where you are
And you always know where I am
We're takin' it way too far
But I don't want it to end
This kiss is something I can't resist
Your lips are undeniable
This kiss is something I can't risk
Your heart is unreliable
Something so sentimental
You make so detrimental
And I wish it didn't feel like this
'Cause I don't wanna miss this kiss
I don't wanna miss this kiss
(This kiss, this kiss, this kiss)
You know you're just my type
And your eyes are lock and key
To my heart, tempting my confession
And you're a real hot thing
But you know I've got a boy somewhere
So, can you feel the tension?
I'm dancin' to where you are
And you're dancin' to where I am
You lean in closer, and I shouldn't, I shouldn't
But if you ask me to, I couldn't, I couldn't
I shouldn't, I shouldn't
Break a bone
Got me on my knees
You break my heart just to watch it bleed
I’m sick with love
Sick, like a disease
Don’t call me up just so I can please you
I can’t stand the way you’re smiling
I can’t stand the way I’m lying
I know, I know, I know you got the key
And you know, you know, you know that it’s for me
It’s not up to you, you know it’s up to me
But curiosity will never let me go
Look at me
Left here in the corner
Stupid girl, I really tried to warn her
Walked the streets all night until you came around
Knew that you would come before you ever even made a sound
So don’t break me tonight
This is crazy love
Through the rain
'Cause I need your love
And you know I’m gonna follow you home
you know I’m gonna follow you
Will never let me go
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up, if you're down to get down tonight
Slept in all my clothes, like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
It's always a good time
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room, hit the ATM
Let's hang out, if you're down to get down tonight
'Cause it's always a good time
Good morning and goodnight
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try, it's always a good time
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there
Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Speak to me (To me)
You're walking closer and it's hard to breathe
I should be running, but the heart's naive
And I expect too much
You were good to me (To me)
I left a scar that no one else can see
And now you're back here
And reminding me that I lost way too much
(Too much, too much, too much)
Do you know that night I almost said I loved you
(Memory, memory, memory)
Say my name (My name)
'Cause no one else can say it quite the same
It takes me back to your September days
I've missed you way too much
If I was cruel to you
Well, just to hear it, breaks my heart in two
If there's a way to make it up to you
I wanna change so much, you know I do
And know that night I almost said I loved you
(Loved you, loved you, loved you)
And you almost said it back?
Stay with me
I really need to hear you breathe
If words can't speak, lay your body next to me
No matter how lame my apology
I let go of you, you let go of me
Are you gonna just stand in front of me
Pretending I'm not your destiny?
More than a memory
Lame my apology
I'm not over you, are you over me?
Are we gonna be more than a memory?
All alone, Here I am
I don't know what I'm after
Now that you're just a friend
I can't call you and ask you
And tonight, here you are
And I know what you're after
But you're reading me wrong
'Cause I'm closing this chapter
And from the very first time I saw your face
I knew I was satisfied
You were talking so sweet, I had to taste
I wish I never tried
I'm breaking up with you, you're breaking up on me
'Cause breaking us in two is breaking me in pieces
Breaking up with you, you're breaking up on me
You kiss me on the phone
And I don't think it reaches
What am I to do?
And how's it gonna be?
I'm giving up and going out tonight
(Why don't you turn me on?)
Turn me up (Why don't you turn me on?)
Turn me on (On, and on, and on)
Turn me up (Why don't you turn me up?)
Turn me on (Turn me on, turn me on)
Turn me up, turn me on
When you smile like a tease
Baby, you don't even know
You don't even know
When my heart skips a beat
darling, every time you go
(every time you go)
I don't ever wanna let you go
All the girls on the block
they come knocking at your door
You just stare out the window, what you waiting for?
(what you waiting for?)
Is it too late or too soon?
I'm right outside here wanting you
Imagine you, imagine me
Together so happily
Imagine me, imagine you
Inside a dream I built for two
When you walk into the room
I can't speak and I can't move
You don't see me, but you should
I don't ever want to let you go
We could take it fast or make it slow
I'm the friend that you misunderstood
Every day is just a "wish I could"
Why you gotta make it hurt so good?
Hello, I know it's been a while
I wonder where you are
And if you think of me
Sometimes 'cause you're always on my mind
You know I had it rough
Tryin' to forget you but
The more that I look around
The more I realize
You're all I'm looking for
What makes you so beautiful is you don't know
how beautiful you are to me
You're not tryin' to be perfect
Nobody's perfect
But you are
To me (to me)
It's how you take my breath away
Feel the words that I don't say
I wish somehow
I could say them now
Just friends
The beginning or the end
How do we make sense
When we're on our own
It's like you're the other half of me
I feel incomplete
Should have known
Nothing in the world compares
To the feelings that we share
It's so not fair
It's not you
Blame it all on me
I was running from myself
'Cause I couldn't tell
How deep that we
We were gonna be
I was scared it's destiny
But it hurts like hell
Hope it's not too late
Just a twist of fate
I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile
with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies
Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
You won't love me back, no
It's not you and I
No more crying to get me through
Over you
We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing till the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
You were here and then you left
And now there's nobody, nobody
Now they're all just second best
There's nobody, nobody
When you're near I feel the best
I'm somebody, somebody
It's in my pulse, it's in my chest
My whole body, whole body
So if you want me
I'll be around
Just hold me closer
Oh won't you hold me down tonight
But if you cut a piece of guitar string
You're in the country
I'm in the town
You're a bird in the water
I'm a fish on the ground
And I wanna be there
For you tonight
And I hope you hear me
Baby I hold on tight
Hold on tight
I would wear it like it's a wedding string
I would wear it like it's a wedding ring
If you cut a piece of guitar string
I would wear it
This is the real thing
Wrapped around my finger
You know what I mean
You make my heart sing
You gave my shirt back
I don't really get the meaning
It's like you're giving up before it all goes wrong
I've been told but I don't really like the feeling
I've been away, I've been away too long
Wake up moon we spend the night alone together
You're a real good listener
but you don't have much to say
Wake up you
you won't pick up the phone whatever
You're probably sleeping, I hope we're still OK
I, I, I wanna go wherever you are
I, I, I wanna be wherever you are
I, I, I wanna see whatever you are
You say love's a fragile thing
Made of glass
But I think
You gotta work it out
Make it stronger
Try for me just a little longer
It's times like this you must recall
Your heart is a muscle
If I could turn this plane around
I'd fly to where you are right now
Write your name into the sky
Hope that it'll light up your eyes
I had a bad dream, You were there, Like you always are
I had a bad day, I don't care, When I'm in your car
Laughing at me in your head
With my teasing games, Let's talk about you
You're in love, Wanna change my name
So drive so fast baby through the night
Drive so fast, and they'll never gonna find you
Drive so fast, saying no goodbyes
Drive so fast, and we'll leave it all behind you
Boy, I get a kick out of you
You know I'm yours
The things you're making me do
I never thought, you'd hit me to the core
I don't care about my lipstick
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love, love
Chasing the sun, don't wanna miss it
I just wanna drive you to love, love, love
You got your way with me now didn't ya
Things you do are things we've done before
Don't you be looking at me darling with your sneaky eyes
Breaking my heart to see you, lover
And I don't know why
Things you say are things you've said before
Instead of the truth I swear you'd stick a needle in your eye
Now what can you be looking at me for?
Sometimes when I'm lonely I close my eyes
Some nights when I can't sleep I fantasize
Hard to believe that you're right here tonight
I'm going out of my mind
'Cause you rule my head
Hold me, be the way you told me
Whisper something so sweet
Tell me what was I supposed to do
With that type of attention
I gave all that I had to you
You forgot to mention
When you say that your heart is true
It's just an invention
But not your intention no, no
I think this could be the one night
I give in to this fight
Boy I just might
'Cause you rule on my head
I can't stop the motion
This could be the night
Wrong feels so right
We were both headed different ways
Both in a rush, trying to get away
I ran into you
Like a crash of thunder
Out in the rain waiting for the bus
We started talking 'bout different stuff
And it's true, there's an eight world wonder
I could be your sweetie
A dinner date and a glass of wine
We stayed up late and lost track of time
When I'm with you I feel a different hunger
You held my hand and you didn't let go
I'm gonna kiss you now
I thought you should know
And it's true there's an eighth world wonder
And from now on
Anything you need
Anything you want boy
I can make it happen
We could fall in love and I could be your sweetie
Anytime of day boy
I'll be your distraction
We can make it happen
I could be your sweetie, sweetie
You're not as lonely as you think you are
I'm trying to tell you
That all I wanna do, is just be true to you
And give you satisfaction
I always want more
I'm never gonna get it
You're gonna be the one I never got that got away
And I'll regret it
Just a moment in time
But I can't forget it
Yeah, we almost said it
If this is love I should be dying
But I'm going downtown like I still care
Like I'm still trying
I said I was over you but I'm lying
There, I almost said it
Every time you look at me
Oh, when will you wake up and get it
I know you're not evil
So why do you tease me
Yeah, staying around here late at night
You don't make it easy
It's in my body language, read me
And it's like every time you look at me
I say it silently
Oh, wake up, baby, come and get it
This close, we almost said it
You say that you're still not free
Well, I hear selectively
That still means someday you might be
You wrote me a song
I often play it
Depending on where I am with you
I either love it or I hate it
We were just this close but we couldn't say it
We were this close
Baby I don't need to look far
Everywhere I turn there, there you are
Somebody should sound the alarm
'Cause when you try to get me alone
You talk to me in riddles
You treat me like a crime
Tip-toein' around all the facts
Tease me till I laugh and I relax
I know there's a reason for that
'Cause you've been tryin' to get me alone
And talk to me in riddles
You cover me in rhymes
So don't kiss me on the lips
Oh don't you tell me what I did
And every time you speak
And I hear she's kinda nice
So don't give me those eyes
You're sick with dreams about it
Didn't I, didn't I blush
I think, I think, I think
I want it way too much
And it cuts me like a knife
And she's gonna be your wife
And every time you speak,
You're lying through you're t-t-teeth
Tell me where is she tonight
'Cause I heard you had a fight
I know you have a girlfriend
Oh won't you let me be
I know you have
I'm beggin' you, stop beggin' me
I know you have, I know you have a girlfriend
I've been thinking about it, I know something's wrong
Fading out in the distance
we've been lost in the songs
Best turn the clocks to somewhere
And if I could hold on to your edge
and fall to your deepest dent
(if I could melt with you)
Hearing echoes and voices, all I couldn't see
We have all kinds of choices
If it was uṗ to me, I'd turn the clocks to somewhere
we won't ever stop, don't ever leave
Tell the world to wait outside, just you and I
We would come through, if I could melt with you
And every time that passes by, I see you, I see you
Every now and then, I like to pretend
If I could melt with you, I would
And find our way back to good
Tell the world to wait outside
If I could hold on to your edge
and fall to your deepest dent
We would come true, if I could melt with you
If we could come true
If I melt with you
You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart, stuck in my body
stuck in my body, body
I wanna go, get out of here, 
I'm sick of the party, party
I'd run away
I'd run away with you
This is the part, you've gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
you've gotta say all that you're feeling, feeling
Packing a bag, leaving tonight while everyone's sleeping, sleeping
tonight while everyone's sleeping, sleeping
Let's run away
I'll run away with you
I wanna be there with you
Baby, take me to the feeling
Baby, every single minute
Up in the clouds, high as a kite
over the city, city
We never sleep, we never try
when you are with me, with me
I wanna stay
I wanna stay here with you
'Cause you make me feel like
I could be driving you all night
And I'll find your lips in the street lights
And I wanna be there with you
Oh, baby, take me to the feeling
Oh, baby, every single minute
Hold on to me
I never wanna let you go
Over the weekend
Run away with me, run away with me
We could turn the world to gold
Over the weekend we could turn the world to gold
Oh, my baby, take me to the feeling
Take me to, take me to it
I'll be your sinner in secret
Just run away
With me
Every single minute
I'll be your hero and win it
When the lights go out
Run away with me
Be tormented by me babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me babe
Let it hit you cool and hot
Let your feelings be revealing
That you can't forget me not
Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing
I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it
And you can forget me not
Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not
What if I turn the lights right down?
You feel it
You and me in the dark right now
I feel it
In your fantasy, dream about me
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion
I really wanna stop But I just got the taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the boy on the moon
So honey hold my hand, you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room
I'm so in my head When we're out of touch
It's like everything you say is a sweet revelation
All I wanna do is get into your head
Yeah we could stay alone
you and me in this temptation
Sipping on your lips, hanging on by a thread
Late night, watching television
But how'd we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
Oh, did I say too much?
I'm so in my head
When we're out of touch (When we're out of touch)
Who gave you eyes like that?
Said you could keep them?
I don't know how to act
Or if I should be leaving
I'm running out of time
Going out of my mind
I need to tell you something
Yeah, I need to tell you something
Oh, did I say too much? (Did I say too much?)
I'm so in my head (I'm so in my head)
I really really really really really really like you
And I want you, Do you want me? 
Do you want me too?
Worlds fly by
Drove by your place and stopped again tonight
I know I said that I'm too scared to try
But I still think about you, think about you
And I can't lie
I like the feeling, how you make me shy
I share my secrets and I will not hide
I know that one could be two, one could be two
Eyes so bright
You got a hold of me the whole damn night
I toss and turn but still I can't sleep right
I should've asked you to stay, begged you to stay
Why when I get right next to you
I hear this heartbeat breaking through?
I feel the earthquake in the room and so I pray
Gimmie touch
(Gimmie love)
Wanna feel like this forever
It's the way we are together
And I never thought I'd ever
Say forever
Gimmie touch (oh touch me)
'Cause I want what I want, do you think that I want too much?
Fall into me and then
Gimmie love
Gimmie please
Cause I want what I want, but with you, it's what I need
Gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love, gimmie love
I wanna play this for you all the time
I wanna play this for you when you're feeling used and tired
I wanna make the best of you and more
I'll be the magic you will ever see
You can always rely on me
To help you do what you want to do
I wanna be the best you've ever known
I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea
I'll keep my light on, baby, you can always come to me
I wanna be the place you call your home
Just let me in your arms
I will never let you come apart
When you need me
I will be your candle in the dark
When you need someone
Oh, let me be the one
The only one
And the only one
(And I will be your friend)
(Show me if you want me)
Show me if you want me
If I'm all that
(Show me if you care)
(Show me that you care)
Oh, show me that you care
I will be that
I will be your friend
Just show me that you care
If you're gonna go then go
If you're gonna stay then stay
He's not gonna change anyway
Finally gotta let it go
She said to me on the phone
It could be the perfect day
You'll just make it rain anyway
So tired of hearin' all your boy problems
From the outside
And I know that she's right
And I should not be offended
That I know what it looks like
From the outside, from the outside
What's worse?
Losin' a lover or losin' your best friend
What's worse is when you discover
You're not good for each other
She's been giving, you've been taking, taking, taking
I think I broke up with my boyfriend today
And I don't really care
I've got worse problems
I broke up with my boyfriend
I've got 'em too
Boy trouble, we've got double
Don't know what to do
Boy problems, who's got 'em?
I've got them too
You and me
we've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down
know what you need to get you high
Top down
like the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside, all of your fears, leave them behind
Eyes wide
like you've never seen the ocean never seen the tides
No hope
now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off
got your hands in the air and you're feeling alright
Gold vines, glistening on my skin for you
Baby I'm speeding and red lights are run
What I got you need it, and I'll run to your side
When your heart is bleeding, I'm coming to get you
Baby take my hand now, don't you cry
I won't let you sleep, I won't let you hide
No more tears, don't waste another day
Go on and fight, don't lay down to die
Come on get up, you'll make it through okay
Come on get up, don't waste another day
I know you've had a rough time
Here I've come to hijack you (hijack you)
I love you while Making the most of the night
I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you
That I will never get to call you mine
I bet she acts so perfectly
You probably eat up every word she says
And if you ever think of me
I bet I'm just a flicker in your head
But I still love you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
And I want you to miss me
When I'm not around you
I know that you're in town
Why won't you come around
To the spot that we met
I'll make time for you
I love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you
I didn't mean to say what I said
I miss you, I mean it, I tried not to feel it
But I can't get you out of my head
I'm not the type of girl for you
And I'm not going to pretend
That I'm the type of girl you call more than a friend
And I break all the rules for you
Break my heart and start again
I'm not the type of girl you call more than a friend
I was never one to want to
Put my trust in someone else completely
And I was always one to want to
Up and run when someone said they needed me
I was always shy and careful
I was sure that you would never look at me
Never wanted to discourage
Everything your eyes encouraged silently
But you, You could be the one
You could be the one
You wanna get lost? (you wanna get lost?)
Let's get lost (let's get lost)
I wanna get lost
Baby let's go get lost
I like that you're drivin' slow
Let's get lost
I don't wanna let you go
Keeping my fingers crossed
That maybe you'll take the long way home
Baby let's take the long way home
I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to L.A
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever
But money makes your whole world spin
Til everything is dizzy and suddenly
Shake me from L.A. hallucinations
Haven't seen the boy in ages
Used to stay up all night he and I
Filling up each of these pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes
We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game 'cause suddenly
Buzzfeed buzzards and TMZ crows
If I just lie here then will you let me go?
There's a little black hole in my golden cup so
You pour and I'll say stop
Planes I'm hopping
Cards I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup
So you pour and I'll say stop
If I just lie here, will you let me go?
Take me into your arms again
What can I say that you don't already know?
And shake me from L.A. hallucinations
I've got a cavern of secrets
None of them are for you
Even if you wanted to keep them
Where would you find the room?
Let down my guard tonight
I just don't care anymore
I've told a hundred lies
But I don't wanna tell you any at all
I saw myself tonight
Saw my reflection in the mirror
My hands and heart were tied
But I was scared of almost nothing at all
And I can not control it
The way you're making me feel
And you have got me going
Spinning in circles 'round your warm blood
Sweet one you should stop me there but I keep on talking
You catch me when I'm falling for you
You catch me when I'm falling
Warm blood feels good, I can't control it anymore
Sweet one, you should stop me there but I keep on talking
I would throw in the towel for you, boy
'Cause you lift me up and catch me when I'm falling for you
Warm blood, underneath my skin
Warm blood, my heart is pumping
What if we could go back?
We could take the words back
You could take my love back
And brush my hair behind my ear
I don't know what you wanted
I tried to be so perfect
I thought that it was worth it
To let myself just disappear
I wake up and I see the light
Once upon a time I thought you were the hero
I waited for you all night
I closed my eyes and slept for years
You kissed me like a sunrise
I feel it through my forehead
I felt it like a goodbye
I'm not myself
You come to me in dreams at night
I'm not goin' to work it out
I don't want to work it out
No I'm not going to still
Sometimes I wish that I could change
But not for me, for you
So we could be together, forever
But I know, I know that I won't change for you
'Cause where were you for me
When I needed someone?
When I needed you?
I don't care about your good intentions
I care more about your bad dreams
I want a love on a new dimension
You know I'm gonna be
In your black heart, is where you'll find me
Cutting through the cracks of the concrete
In your black heart, is where you'll find me waiting
You think love is a destination
Like a show on your TV
You'll cry to your generation
But don't you cry to me
Under the blossom tree
Come a little closer, won't you come a little closer to me
You're my miracle
Now it's happening, now it's happening (black heart)
Everything you ever wanted
Now it's happening, under the blossom tree (black heart)
It's your fault, baby boy 
'cause you're the one that sparked this
Shine a light, with your eyes into me in the darkness
Hey Joe's calling me over
Tino's calling me over
It's you boy, you in the corner
Something is taking me over
I only came here for you
Baby I, I'm not going anywhere without you
Drive me home, 'cause I like every single thing about you
I didn't just come here to dance
If you know what I mean
Do you know what I mean
If you just give me a chance
You'd see what I see
Do you see what I see
Hold on now
This is gettin' kinda serious
This is gettin' kinda out of control
Out of control
Slow down now
Breathin' heavy when it's just a kiss
This is gettin' kinda out of my hands
Out of my hands
Should I stay?
Making love until the morning light
Making out like it's the end of the world
And I really wanna get it right
But it's gettin' hard to slow down
Got me feelin' like it's real for sure
This is gettin' kinda out of my head
I'm out of my head
'Cause when I'm close to you
Paint me up
Please don't go
Look real close
Eyes that show Kaleidoscopes
When I'm close to you
We blend into my favourite colour
I'm bright baby blue
Fallin' into you, falling for each other
Paint me up, me up, me up
You're my favourite colour
You know I didn't mean it darling
Sweet like the morning light
Gone late into the evening
All I want is to hold you
Make you rock away this feeling for me
Oh sugar sugar spice and all things nice
I'll be there for you
Just say you'll stay the night
I need you till the morning light
'Cause oh darling don't you know
My only heart is beating for you
Oh baby don't you go
You know I didn't mean it
Until I saw you in my thunderstorm
I didn't see
I wanna be the one that's in your arms
I wanna feel you
But I don't think anybody understands you
I don't think anybody understands you
The way I do, the way I do
I know you'll let it go to head
If I say I'll stay
I never get to hold you
As long I want to
Remember I told you
You're all that I need
Stars, won't you shine on me
Won't you dance with me
Me and my baby
Life, is enough to cry
It's a lot to give and it's driving me crazy
And even now my love is true
Moon, where's the man in you
Show the way to us
The sky is turning black now
Moon, what you trying to do
It's too late for us and there's no turning back now
I never meant to fight with you
I wanted us to stay together
And even now our love is true
I know that we can't be together
Open up your heart to the ceiling
Don't you know it hurts for a reason
Somewhere out there someone is breathing
Just for you their heart keeps on beating
Time will take you back to believing
You'll learn to love again
You are the heartbreak
First time
Catching tears like raindrops here in the glass
Keep them safe in case you should ever ask
Or if you'd like, we don't need to talk about it
I don't care
I will wait right here by my windowsill
For the sun to come, if it ever will
Everyone says I can never get my fill but I don't care
Looking back, I followed you everywhere
We were kids just playing with truth and dare
Lets be honest, no one else can take me there
But I don't care
We won't get too sentimental, not tonight
I could meet you in the middle, we won't fight
'Cause when my heart breaks
Through the heartbreak
We'll make it feel like the first time, first time
Don't you? I hope that you want to
Make it up and start it over
Feels like the first time
'Cause when my heart breaks
It always feels like the first time, first time
But if you stay here
We'll make it feel like the first time
And if you stay here
We could kiss away the goodbye, goodbye
I was lost, alone and searchin'
For someone who understands
Me for who I really am
Didn't know that I was hurtin'
'Til you left me up inside
And he opens up my eyes, oh
Oh you got me high, high, higher
Toss and turn, a few mistakes but
You quite didn't show me how
Never let me hit the ground
All the love was hesitating
But ever since you came around
I feel more than safe and sound
If you wanna know if I'm thinkin'
Ever since you came I'm livin'
On top of the world, I can't deny
Every one of my fears has vanished
And I don't know how you managed
To wake me up and come alive
your love Turns me on, Gets me higher, Takes me up
your love Turns me on
Gets me higher, Takes me up
You take me higher than the rest
Oh everybody else is second best
(Second best, second best)
You pulled a gem out of the mess
I was so cynical before, I must confess
Truth is I never thought of us together
You're just a friend of mine
We should know better
This can't last forever
Kiss me one more time
We're cookin' dinner, I wear your socks and slippers
It's been a long, long day
It's just so easy, love the way you read me
I never have to say
Romance is fine, pour me some wine
Tell me it's just for the fun of it
Far from your eyes, hard to deny when
I don't want love, don't want none of it
Don't fall in love, fall in love
If you want to, you can stay the night
If you want to, you can hold me tight
It's too much pressure
I don't want to be the one, the one
Don't tell me this is how it ends
I burn a fever that I caught from you
My breath was lost when you said "friends"
Well that could work but I'm still hot for you
So I stole your bike
And I rode all night
But I'm so damn scared
You don't even care
I've still been sleeping at my friend's
Dropped off your helmet and lock for me
I wrote some things I didn't send
Three words to say that meant a lot to me
So I rode your bike
To your house last night
And I'm so damn scared
'Cause your car's not there
Don't break my heart tonight
You wanna break my heart, alright
You want a brand new start, alright
And my lights stay up, but your city sleeps
It's a different world when you're not here with me
Go on and break my heart tonight
I caught your fever, I'll be feeling it forever
I think I'm in trouble, I can't see the end
I call you my lover, you call me your friend
I'm keeping it secret, yeah even from you
I call you my lover, oh what can I do?
I've been lonely baby, I
This could be perfect, that we could be free
To do what we wanted, you do it to me
We only just started, don't say it's the end
So call me your lover, don't call me your friend
I've been lonely baby
I've been hangin' on the line
(Been hangin' on the line)
And if you love me baby, don't
Don't, don't hang up this time
'Cause you know
I just think we're overthinking it, I think we're overthinking it
I just think we're overthinking it, don't think it over
Don't think it over
Body language will do the trick
If you stay with me tonight, then we'll talk it over
That's the danger with missing it
I just think we're overthinking it
I think we're overthinking it
Don't need to move, I've got the spotlight
I want you to say
He never wants to cry
He always makes me cry
Flood in my room, I see your headlights
And you got your reasons
You've got a way that makes it alright
Do you want to?
I want you to stay tonight
I want you to stay
I want you to
Wake up without you
I wake up without you, boy
You're king of the castle
Whenever you're here, you know it feels right
Don't need to worry
He never wants to strip down to his feelings
He never wants to kiss and close his eyes
I never really know when he'll be leaving
And even with hello I hear goodbye
Sunlight, moves upon my skin
Wake up and I'm next to you
But I wish that I was next to him
Looks like this could be the end
Know that you'll be alright
Maybe one day we'll be friends
But you know me, I'm...
Don't cry
I can't play pretend
Wish it hadn't come to this
But you know there's some things you can't mend
But you know me, I...
Ask where we're going, oh, I
Can't talk about it, can't talk about it 'cause
I just wanna say I'm sorry
Alright, I'm so alright this time
I'm not that good at goodbyes
Sometimes it's best to just fly
I'm just goin' to the store, to the store
You might not see me anymore, anymore
I'm just goin' to the store
Knock on the door, leaving it open
It wasn't you, why was I hoping?
Said it before and I'll say it again
That I'll always be here when you need a friend
Cat got your tongue, it's been forever
Have you been good? Have you been better?
I've said it before, I'll say it again
That I'll always be here if you need a friend
I sat with you on my bedroom floor
And I couldn't move, all that we were losing
I saw you like I never did before
I never did before
And I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of seasons and you're back
Yeah I can feel you reaching through the cracks
A simple change of heart and you attack
All the roses in the garden fade to black
Drunk on cigarettes
Last chance, say the words
Dancing in the dark
Love made in the park
Big black blossom tree
I won't take it back
Baby cover me
Hold me, left to blow
Please don't let me go
I had to go, I'm sorry
I hope you'll understand
That even though it's over
You know it's not the end
I couldn't be your half
Just forming out a whole
Find solace in your soul
You thought that I'd feel empty
I just want a hand to hold
But now that it's all over
My life isn't so cold
I can't complete you, baby
But I will hold you in my heart
And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
But your story cannot start until you've grown
You can find how to be OK on your own
I just can't be the one that makes you feel at home
So I can comprehend
I'm not so scared to admit
I could use a friend (a friend, yeah)
I need some time to myself
To gain some confidence
Another confidant
'Til I can fall again
Maybe we knew that from the start
It wasn't meant to be
I could use a friend
Woke up this morning
It feels like everyday
I got the blues babe
Not going away
Another bad dream
Where you were running away
We had our moment
We had our summertime
Asked me to leave with you
But I could never decide
I've been so torn up
I've been so out of it
I tried another To keep me satisfied
But all your colors are Still dancing in my mind
More than just lovers
I'm forever haunted by our time
I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night I pray
When you coming home, coming home?
'Cause I've been living for that day
Through the last breath that I breathe
through the last breath that I breathe
Julien, in your heart yeah you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, through the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering Julien
Take me to the limit, hold me down there
You're tryna make it easy, you know that I care
You say you love me but you wouldn't dare-are
I can see you spinning around in your head
(There's a little ghost of us)
A little history of us in there-ere
And now we've finally got to the safe other side
(Something's coming over us)
Why would we risk it for another try?
(Another try, come alive)
Oh, starry eyes, blurry eyes
Feeling so intoxicated
Worried eyes, I'm open wide
Take me so up and down
Your head high, hold on, baby
And if you make me feel in love then I'll blossom for you
If you make me open up, I'll tell only the truth
(All for you)
When your mouth is running dry
Keep head high, hold on, baby
You ain't tried no drug like me
Waking up next to you every morning
How did we get this far?
It came without a warning
And in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
You and me get too real but all I feel is alright
Don't give it up, don't say it hurts
I want it all
Give me the words I want, baby, just say it
You know me way too well to keep it complicated
I don't wanna hide my love
I don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)
But I can't deny the moment when I taste it
My heart's a secret, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I think I'm coming alive with you
Tell me you'll keep it, I think I'm coming alive, yeah
I come alive with you
Don't give it up (Don't give it up)
Thought it was impossible
It's just like a miracle
Say nothing's impossible now
Now that I found, now that I found you
Don't say it hurts (Don't say it hurts)
'Cause there's nothing like this feeling, baby
I want it all (I want it all)
No, there's nothing like this feeling, baby
Now that I found you
When all the lights out, hey, where you goin'?
I'd keep a window for ya if I was open
I'm like a lighthouse
I'm a reminder of where you're goin'
I'm in your head now and every second now
is your love going?
Oh, with you, I'm gonna get bolder
(I just wanna get) a little bit closer
When no one loves you like they really mean it
I got you covered, under covers
Can you feel it?
Oh, with you, I got to get bolder
(I just wanna get a little bit closer)
Hey, and I press you to the pages of my heart
Don't go, no, the night's not over
And I press you to the pages of my heart
On the bed, on the floor
I don't care anymore
I wanna do bad things to you
Slide on through my window
(I want you in my room)
Baby don't you want me too?
He's strong, not want to settle down
You know he's that guy
Electric, those lips can wear me out
Well, I think he's all mine
It's crazy, but when he can't sleep I understand
Like pressure points, my love can ease him in my hand
'Cause (He needs me)
Soft rain (Soft rain)
We roll the windows down
Sweat disco all night
It's clear (It's clear)
We'd like to fool around
His hands reach for mine
I know it's tough
Baby, keep both eyes on the road
A right, a burnt-out streetlight, only halfway home
Enough of my love
You know, not just physically
Emotionally, spiritually, intellectually, sexually
All the ways
He needs me, he needs me
(I got everything he needs)
Can never give him enough
Enough of my
I can never give him enough
Enough of my love, enough of my love
(He needs me)
I fight, I fight
All my feelings for you all night, all night
Don't stay, don't stay
I've got feelings for you I hide, I hide
All our friends that I know
They've been trying to set us up together
I lie, I lie
I say somebody else would suit you better
But I'll only go so far
I don't have the energy
To risk a broken heart
And you're already killing me
I'll turn your love away 'cause I want to sleep at night
It's just that my broken heart is my alibi
I'm afraid, afraid, afraid, afraid of knowing
What I'm knowing, what I'm knowing
But if there's something between you and me
Baby, I have no time for it
I'm happy not knowing
And please don't stir it up
I'm sure it's nothing but some heartburn, baby
And I'm happy not knowing
Where this goes?
How this goes? (Happy not)
If this goes (I'm happy not)
But I'm happy not knowing
Night in love, I can see you're sold out
Where was I picked, but you caught my eyes out
"He's so hypnotising", said every girl you ever met
When I lose, when I lose, I hold out
Tell me all, I'm jealous of that night watch
I'm the voyeur searching through my laptop
It's so truth defying, everything you ever said
Right or wrong, right or wrong
I won't stop
Standing at your door, calling out your name
Find me in the dark, find me here again
Banging on your door, calling out your name
Find me in your heart, find me here again
I've got nothing left, like a little protest
Living for you
Oh, but you're living for her
I go crazy, see red when she's touching you, now
You're my baby
Come to bed, I'll be your girl
All I mean is I'm holding, out of breath
For the way that I feel when you hold me like that
All I pray is I'm getting over it
I'll change places today if you love me like that
Am I bad for you?
'Cause I live for the fire, and the rain, and the drama too, boy
And it feels like you never say what you want
And it feels like I can't get through, babe
Am I too close?
'Cause you fold into me like a heart with a beat
I know now, I know now
And did you know that I'm wild for your skin
And the dance that we're in, so close now, so close now
'Cause when I get so low, it takes me higher (Feel the love)
I'm not afraid to know my heart's desire
Is this too much to made a season
It's hard to get to know me
Are you down?
Adjust to trust the feeling
It's hard to get to know you
But I'm down
When I party, then I party too much
When I feel it, then I feel it too much
When I'm thinking, then I'm thinking too much
When I'm drinking, then I'm drinking too much
I'll do anything to get to the rush
Now I'm dancing, and I'm dancing too much
So be careful if you're wanting this touch
'Cause if I love you, then I love you too much
Is this too, is this too
Is this too much?
(I give up, I give up, I give up, I give up)
I've been testing out the waters
I don't think I can swim, love
With the way you rock me 'round
And the feeling, love or just desire?
I don't think I can breathe
With the way you let me down
I don't need the words, I want the sound
(Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound)
I don't need the words, I want the
Fool's gold landed on my shoulder
In the weight of your hand
But you know the answer's no
And you know I'm a liar
Oh, the night's my weakness
I believe every word
'Cause your lips are waterfalls
I'm for you now, I feel my fortune tell me I'm the only one
I'm for you now (Is it desire?)
it's sweet until it's over
I'm the only one (Is it desire?)
God, you make me so tired
Isn't this the vision that you wanted?
Guess I'll never understand you now
Love is more than telling me you want it
I never thought about you
You never thought about us
Yeah, it came out of the blue
And I was just dreaming
It took a night of insane
To feel the need of your touch
And I could never explain
How I was just dreaming
Never guessed what came after
I fell
It's not the fear that you trust
It's not the voice in your head
We got the chemical rush
And now we're just dreaming
And we could wait for the proof
A little time to adjust
But every moment with you
I wake up just dreaming
We were automatically in love
In love, in love
Mhm, La-da-da-da-da, da-da
Love's so fast, I can't go slow
Hold me back
Baby boy, hold me close
Love's so real, I can't go slow
Can't imagine, by the way I'm feeling so
Automatically in love
Right away, baby, it's a real rollercoaster
When the wind goes the other way
But you and me, right away, baby
Right away, right away, baby
Just a girl undercover and a boy with the getaway
You and me, right away, baby
We put everything away
California wasn't made for you
Hate the traffic in LA
I drove through it all to get to you
You always got the right words at the wrong
I don't wanna see your face
I'm afraid I couldn't wait for you
I'm afraid that I would break
Only want me when I'm leaving you
Took a million miles to feel the final separation
Don't you tell me now you know what you need
I need to find a love to love me with no hesitation
Don't you tell me now you're ready for me
My baby, my baby
This time, it's heartbreaking
(It's getting late, I gotta say now)
Baby boy, you've always got the right words
(That you should go, yeah, you should go home)
But you always say them at the wrong time
My baby (It's getting late)
My baby (And you should go, and you should go)
(It's getting late)
This time, it's heartbreaking (It's getting late now)
(And you should go, and you should go)
You always got the right words at the wrong time
(And you should go, you should go)
For me, for me
('Cause) You always got the right words at the wrong time
Feels good waking up in your way
My heart needed a holiday
I bet we can make things slide into Monday
I've been living with no regrets
Love was just a night at best
Two step, making the weekend slide into something
'Cause it feels like I've never loved
Now I got ya, and I only think of you
Now I'd do, boy
Anything to step with you
True fact
Maybe I love you back, don't ask
Nothing I want to say
We know timing isn't right
(Maybe one day)
'Til then, steal me a free weekend
You're my complicated friend
I'm just keeping the dream alive
But I must say
One more night with you always turns to two
Can't help it 'cause it feels right, when it feels right
Feels like I've been wasting time
Look at all the things I've left behind
I don't know a thing I've done
Livin' all my life for no damn one
You're the one to change my mind
'Cause it feels right, when it feels right
The world is going crazy
And it feels like I just don't know who to trust sometimes
We're getting good at lying
No one's saying what's keeping us all awake at night
Something's coming over me, I need to get a hold of you now
All the chaos falling 'round
I watch it like a movie that has come to life
Something kind of numb
'Bout the way I keep on drowning it out
Danger, I feel danger
And I cannot find the breath to scream the words out right
Every thought is paralyzing
Need to find a way to you now
Standing here with you tonight
How did we turn on the light?
I've got the feeling that the writing's on the wall
I'm so used to the lie, you're so down to deny
I've got the feeling you're the right thing after all
Real, real, real love
I go everyday without it
And I've been feeling weak without it
Only want a real, real love
(Real, real, real love)
I'm not even scared about it
Well, I don't know a thing about it
All I want is real, real love
Six in the morning, can I hold you?
Are we done talking? Do we have to?
Now I know what you want But it's too late
Trying to bring the color of loving
But it won't take
I've been thinking, we were over
I've been thinking, got to know for sure
Got to know for sure
I was thinking we were over
If you didn't know that you were right for me
Then there's nothing I can say
Try to call you up to spend some time to see
But somebody's in your way
Tried to let it go and say I'm over you
I'm not over you
Once upon a time, I thought you wanted me
Was there no one else to kiss?
(No one else to kiss)
Was it all a dream I let myself believe?
I'm not over this
But I'm trying
I'll be the one
'Cause you don't care about me
You don't want my love
I'll just dance for myself
If you don't care about me
Making love to myself
Back on my beat
Party for one
For some time
I've been waiting for your star to shine So bright
I should say that it's your right to hurt me, baby
And for some time
I've been singing you a lullaby
Each night whispering that
It's your right to hurt me, baby
If you wanted to
For some time I've been pillow talking in my head
My heart's vulnerable, but in my bed I want you, baby
And all you put me through
The other night I swear I saw you in my dream
We didn't say too much, but I understood everything
That you could hurt me, baby, and I could hurt you too
Oh, but love isn't cruel
That's why we got to hold on, baby
We could believe that this love isn't crazy
And through the seasons I'm holding your hand now
I want you back
And I feel it bad
(I know it and I feel it, yeah, this love it isn't crazy)
Every day, want you more, we were so insecure
Every day, learning more, we were so immature
We got to hold on, baby
We could believe that
You gotta stand where I stand
Who could believe that you're holding my hand now
This loving could save me
This love isn't crazy
Baby, I could praise you
Try to turn your head around
Could you take a compliment
Everything I say you
I find a way to drown it out
Make it like an argument
I see you a different way
So take my eyes to borrow
I know you're not sleepin'
Thinking that the sky could fall
You never let the dreams get in
Oh-oh, and
The secrets that you're keepin'
Well, I want you to share them all
'Cause baby, I can handle it
Just hold my hand a different way
And take my eyes to borrow
Not just anybody
Keep you wanting more
And I need your love
I'll be your special somebody
God, I love your body
Keep a window for me open, open for me
Always, please don't lock the door
I'll be your special somebody
Hands over your body
Keep me wanting more
You were the one
But I can't take much more of your hesitating
Wherever I go I still see your face
So little time there's no time to waste
Reading your mind's getting hard to do
Breaking my heart if you don't come through
I can't stay away
(Away away away away)
But, I can't take much more of your hesitating
And if my love's too strong for you, walk away
Those sweet summer lies
Your night after night
Come closer I'll hold you
I need you now, now
It's still on my mind
Yeah time after time
Come closer, come closer
Oh, if it was only an attraction
How come nobody ever felt this way?
Oh, you were a party to the action
I think nobody ever felt this way
If it was only a distraction
How come I can't stay away?
I tried your mouth and I can't come back
So little time and I'm way off track
I can't stay away for one night
Hey, wherever I go I still see your face
So little time, there's no time to waste
The city's so hard when you sleep alone
I need your hands when you drive me home
I can't stay away, away, away, away for one night
Hey, I don't know where your head is now
Don't know where your head is now
I've been only thinkin 'bout us
Don't know what your hands are doin'
I've been only thinkin 'bout touch
Touch, touch, touch me
I can't take much more of your hesitating
Both our hands speak for us and complicate it
If my love's too strong for you, walk away
But I can't make this wrong when I see your face
My home is your body
How can I stay away?
We're on the right track, I can feel it
I came alive first day that we met
I know what everybody's talkin' 'bout
Wanna say it loud and proud
Got me feelin' confident
You make my heartbeat work overtime
I want your body right over mine
So won't you cover me like full eclipse
Can't remember loneliness
Got me feelin' delicate
Feels like Never gonna be the same
I like to give as good as I get
Don't be surprised if this is the best
I'm always fallin' for your open mind
Love the way you open mine
Sweatin' like its summertime
And when you hear me callin' your name
It's always different never the same
And every morning when I wake you up
Sugar you won't need a cup
You got me feelin' confident
Feels like
Never gonna be the same
All the hearts we broke
We broke for reasons
Can't look back the broken pieces
All the hearts we broke We broke for reasons
This is what they say
No I can't look back at broken pieces
Falling in love supposed to feel like
Of the hearts we broke
Broke for reasons
Thinkin' that I need you to go now
'Cause this could really get out of hand
I'm hidin' things I don't wanna show now
'Cause I don't know if you're ready for that
I was busy sleepin', sleepin' with you
'Cause everything about you Is speedin' up my heartbeat
You're better off without me
Is speedin' up my Heartbeat
Heartbeat
Everything's a little bit clearer
How my body feels in your hands
It makes me want to get a little bit nearer
But I don't know if you're ready for that
I was busy sleepin', sleepin', with you
I thought I'd never feel this way, but I do
And I don't wanna tell you
Anything about me
'Cause everything about you
Is speedin' up my heartbeat
I don't know if you should hear this
'Cause it's a mess inside my head
Maybe you should go instead
I'm suddenly scared of my feelings
This might be all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted to happen to me, to me, to me
You've been like a light
Like a light
Summer love wild and free
Summertime wild and free
And I'd like to get to know you
'Cause I live for the feeling
It's my turn it's our time
And I'd like to talk it over
Summer love sweet as wine
And I'd like to have you over
'Cause I live for the feeling
I just live for the feeling
Dance to the feeling
Wait for the feeling of you
I was down for the first night
And I'm down for a second try
When you touch me I wanna fly
I'm so down for you all the time
All the time
He's born in Vegas among the stars
And on his cheek beauty mark
Barely noticed it from the start
A constellation to stir my heart
I was born a dreamer
I'm still that way
Live for tomorrow or yesterday
Every night I'm wearing my black in case you're comin' 'round
Fifty-seven days and it still feels like I'm not comin' down
The night we painted over your fake Mona Lisa
Lipstick on the corners, said her smile was teasin' ya
Oh, you took my clothes off, said, "It's gettin' hotter."
Don't know how to swim, but let's breathe underwater
What it feels like when I'm next to you
It's a soft touch that I read into
Was it just me?
Did you linger for too long?
But it's all right if it's on your mind
'Cause it's all I'm thinking all the time
There was one thing that I wanted all my life For real
Somebody wants you
Somebody cares
Then he said I love you
This is a new thing
One more drink, let's get to the bottom of it
I love you, Let's sort the whole thing out
Let's sort the whole thing out
I was broken in a million ways
Then I met you and I saw your face
I was certain I could not want something more
Goin' crazy 'cause you're hard to read
But I know you want this bad as me
It's a good thing and I want you to be sure
Never thought I'd hear you say I've been hopin' every day
Never thought I'd hear you say
I've been hopin' every day
I'm at a war with myself
We go back to my place
Take my makeup off
Show you my best disguise
You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
It's a tragedy boy
Every time you ask me
I'm at peace in the dark
When I know that you're near
Hear the breath of your heart
Singing me a lullaby
All those travelin' years
'Til we said our goodbye
And I show up to your place
You don't even ask me why
But I'm thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
And if you wanna know why I have no regrets
Sometimes you've gotta dig low to get 'round to it
And there is nothing I'm so sure of
Nothing I'm so sure of
If you wanna know why I have no regrets
Well, then you'll come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And I am the keeper
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Come back to me
Come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
Come baby, dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
And I know what it feels like
To be alone on a cold night
No one you can hold tight
And I'm not tryin to play it down
But it's all gonna turn around
And I swear you'll be all right
Don't go wasting your nights gettin' so low
It looks nice from the outside
When they all got the perfect guy
Hold on for the long ride (Long ride)
But your fears got it all wrong
That he's right and there's something wrong
'Cause I swear you'll be all right (All right)
He let go, she moved on
A thousand stories before
You felt it, then lost it
You're lonely, your heart aches
But get yourself off the floor
I can't stand to see you cryin'
Don't go wasting your nights gettin' so low
So what, you're not in love
You shine bright by yourself dancing solo
My lover don't mind if
I'm high as a kite when I'm with him
All of the time
I know that he noticed
I follow him 'round
He's all kinds of hardness and heartless
But I know he's down
He gives me the holiday I needed all the time
Maybe this is temporary I don't even mind
Now I don't hate California after all
Moon in the water and the open sky
I just wanna stay
Another night, another day
We could wash the world away
We could play like children play
Love on the beach and the tide is high
Call out your persuasions
I got the feeling that you don't know what to say, it's a
A black dress occasion
Nobody's dying, it's a dinner not a date, but I
Feel young and inspired
That this is over and I'm hoping you'll agree so I
Phase out and smile over
That little phrase, it isn't you, baby, it's me
You take it, the bottle down
Man, this is easier than how I thought it'd go
You're smiling like a devil
You tell me you were coming here to let me know that
It's over when it's over
And it's over, baby
So take the tarot card and tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again
(See you never)
I had a really nice time with you
I mean, you're sort of a dick sometimes but
Someone out there is surely gonna love a dick
Uh, check please?
Let's be friends then never speak again
It's cool, we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends
(Catch you later)
Never gonna see you again
(I'll see you never)
Let's be friends
Not really though
And it hit me like a lightning bolt
When I'm just about to lose control
I know, I know the feeling
'Cause you never wanna get too close
(always on my mind)
Scared of thunder when I hear it calling
You're looking at me like the sky is falling
I know, I know the danger
Got me feeling like a lightning bolt
Right now I'm on your lips
But you are always on my mind
I don't wanna be another one of your loves
I don't wanna be another one, I want only you
You're always on my mind
You are always on my mind
Like every day and night
You're always on my mind (always on my mind)
You're like a holiday
I know we'll make it, babe
I hope it lasts a lifetime
And I'm not scared to say
That you are always on my mind
I had a dream, or was it real?
We crossed the line and it was on
We crossed the line, it was on this time
I've been denying how I feel, you've been denying what you want
You want from me, talk to me baby
I want some satisfaction
take me to the stars
just say "oh"
Cancel your reservations, no more hesitations this is
I can't make it stop, give me all you got
I want it all or nothing, no more inbetween, now give your
Everything to me, let's get real baby
A chemical reaction, take me in your arms and make me "oh"
Ah, I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
Take me to emotion, I want to go all the way
Show me devotion and take me all the way
All the way, all the way, all the way
Take me, take me, take me all the way
I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling
I wanna dance on the roof
No chemical could recreate our chemistry
Got what I need, need, need
I'm technical, but I lose sensibility
When you're next to me
I feel a boom, feel a bang inside my soul, love
When you lay me down
Of my senses now
Like oh my God
I go from zero to a million when you dim the lights
You get me high, high, high
When you whisper in my ear, I hear a lullaby
So sing to me all night
I feel the boom, feel the bang from head to toe, love
When you caress me down
When you do it that way, I lose control, love
You know you got me now
I think I might love you
You got me flying and falling till four in the morning
Can you hear my body is calling your name?
And when you're gone you should know that you're all that I'm wanting
And I'll always be feeling the same
I think I might love you
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew
I think I might love you
I think I might love you (I think I might love you)
'Cause I only liked a lot of things before I knew (Hey)
The way I love it when you touch me now
So I've been tryin' hard to open up
When I lost someone
it hit me rough
I paid to toughen up in therapy
She said to me, Soften up
sorry if I push your good away
push your good away
Especially when I'm needing you to stay
I know you hate that I still test your love
test your love
trying not to fuck this up
But the benefit of all the broken hearts
the benefit of all the broken hearts
broke before they could break me
before they could break me
a little bit of life regrets
on't bring that mess to you 
when you're with me
I want to be brave enough to show you
brave enough to show you
My not-so-perfect family
And I want be 
brave enough for everything
Surrender my heart 
out here in the open
I wanna get closer 
I'll believe in you every night
I wanna be open, I wanna be honest with you
soldier through my hardest days
switch it off, ignore the pain
I craved to feel it all entirely
In your arms, baby
I'll believe in you every night 
Every night 
Running from the night
drove miles away to finally feel alone 
There's no moon in sight
But the desert lights could lead the way back home
I'm in the moment, livin' undercover, paintin' on each other
I'm in the moment
living undercover 
painting on each other
All the colors, I can't get enough
California dreaming's never what it seems
but Here it comes
I know what I must do now
Give me paradise
I'll eclipse the stars and fall like ones before
eclipse the stars 
and fall like ones before
I'm like Aphrodite
And it's fine to only know the things I know
I'm feeling dramatic
I like the moon and the magic of this
I was always invisible
Consequences are difficult to face
We coulda been somethin' beautiful
But you made it impossible to stay
So tell me what you got on your mind
What you got on your mind
Am I keepin' you up at night?
Keepin' you up at night
I'll never let you be, no
Are you thinkin' of me when you're with somebody else?
Do you talk to me when you're talkin' to yourself?
Are you reachin' for me, makin' love to someone else?
Do you talk to me
When you're talkin' to yourself
You were never just miserable
Without takin' me with you all the way
Don't it hit you subliminal
Now that I'm not the only one who's takin' the blame?
Does it kill you that you're thinkin' of me?
I'd give this love a second try
First, I just imagined all your qualities and that's my fault
just imagined all your qualities 
and that's my fault
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
I'd like to get to know you
Let me kiss all of these tears comin' down
I heard a night bird singin'
Your face is calmin' me down
Maybe I'll just stop thinkin'
Just tell me you need me side by side
The sweetest words of my whole life
Oh, baby, not far away, not far away from that conversation
Just tell me you need me 
side by side
baby, not far away
not far away from that conversation
Tryin' not to talk first
'cause words don't mean authority
And you look powerful just standin' tall in front of me
standin' tall in front of me
But if you could put my feet back on the ground
We could try to introduce ourselves
Smudged red lipstick on you
I'm so satisfied
We spilled that coffee cup
On my couch a thousand times
Oh, now I smile at strangers
I'm that annoying type
Who don't care if there's traffic
'Cause I've got plans tonight
Later we'll meet at your place
Later we'll be together
Ever since you said that you were mine
Everything's going my way, and I like to get my way
Even when things go sideways, rainin' on my parade
I get all my confidence from you
One more cutе disaster
Said I love you twice
Bеfore you could even answer
It's hard here in paradise
I'm living to look at your face
Living it up together
(Ever since you said)
Boy number one made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
It was good though
Boy number two had a beautiful face
I highly agreed to go back to his place
His wife really had some impeccable taste
She was sweet though
I've been on this ride
This roller coaster's a carousel
And I'm getting nowhere
Boys around the world, I want to believe that
When you chase a girl, it's not just huntin' season
it's not just huntin' season
I can see the future
say it like you mean it
I got a beach house in Malibu
And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings
gonna hurt your feelings
I'm probably gonna hurt you
Boy number twelve had a look in his eyes
Brought up his ex and he started to cry
Told me he loved me the very first night
Who knows what I'm in for with
Boy number I-can't-keep-count-anymore
Got a weekend in paradise
And I'm probably gonna never call you
I got big plans to take care of you
I just need to borrow ten thousand dollars
I got a lake house in Canada
And I'm probably gonna harvest your organs
Sunshine somewhere in Mexico
Long day, I didn't feel so good
Lonely, am I bein' sensitive?
Blue eyes, you are the sensitive one
Just say this isn't happenin'
It's too late for that flight
To see you, how can this be life?
How can this be life?
I can feel the sun on you
Warm me up the way you do
After all the clouds have dried
Here's a jar of tears I've cried
Keep it in a sacred place
Hold me in your humble grace
'Cause I can feel the darkness sometimes too
Moonlight, stars in the water glow
stars in the water glow
Swim out, baptize me indigo
Just me and all of my cousins know
Blue eyes, we are the sensitive ones
Tell me this isn't happenin' 
(This isn't happening)
In tree forts, I'll see you
True wild one, where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?
Where's your home tonight?
California, it crossed my mind
Once, we were pressed into the—
Love, we were pressed into the breeze up on the mountain
breeze up on the mountain
pressed into the breeze up on the mountain
I was by your side
Do you remember A conversation with our heads against the pillow?
Dust my shoes before I enter through your doorstep
I was on your side
Comin' in like a western wind
Do you feel home from all directions?
First bloom, you know it's spring
Remindin' me, love, that it's all connected
Oh, what is love?
A jubilation, a celebration
Take me back into your corner
To the center of the room we made a dancefloor
I was charmed to let go
But could you give me peace of mind
If I return to you in time, my golden arrow?
So nice, how refreshing, you crush all the competition
You can ask me if I'm busy tonight
I could be free for you and me
And maybe we could go for a drive
So light, keep it easy 'cause I'm kinda independent
But I really need to stay on your mind
No other guy can help me fly
And hold me down at the same time
So nice, incredibly honest
Polite, so nice all night
He's right to me, it's turnin' me on that
He's the kind of superstar that would only steal your heart
So nice
All of the reasons I know
back in the middle of what could be complicated
But it's different, yeah, it's easy this time
it's easy this time
Communicate, don't make me wait
And say whatever comes through your mind ("I love you")
He's my cup of tea
sugar on my street
Hope he never leaves
I hope he never leaves me
'Cause he's all of the reasons I know
Give me all of the reasons
Apple of my eye, he took me by surprise
He swept me off my feet, I hope he never leaves me
I don't remember, I don't remember you
try not to go there
need a spotless mind
I was born in November, you were born in a different moon
born in a different moon
The push and the pull there
you were born in a different moon
What do you want this time?
Cross the rivers of my mind
You're my little rock skipper, skipper, skipper, skipper
Every time I close my eyes
You're my little heart hiccup, give it up
is it my destiny?
I wanna do a bad thing twice
A critical test to mе
Can't stop feelin' the rain beforе the thunder
I thought it through and I wanna do a bad thing twice
You were the king and I was a soldier, babe
I fought for your attention
Fought for your lonely eyes
I had a vision I had to run away
Let's play this thing over
I wanna go back in time
Caught that fever, I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame (Only got me to blame)
Caught that fever
I shouldn't be here
Only got me to blame 
(Only got me to blame)
I might sleep with you tonight, if you wanna know why
 if you wanna know why
Just because summertime and you look fine
Press my back against the door of the refrigerator
When the heat wave comes, ice can't melt how hot we felt
When the heat wave comes
ice can't melt how hot we felt
But I still believe in my New York City
Lots to do and the boys so pretty
Can't believe I've been gone so long
We can turn it on
Just sweat all my fears away, dancin' through the dark
Saw your angel face, caught my shootin' star
I got you now, I'm Scorpio, it's physical, it's natural
caught my shootin' star
I got you now, I'm Scorpio, 
it's physical, it's natural
I believe there's a true connection with you and mе
Just sweat all my fears away
dancin' through the dark
Saw your angel face
caught my shootin' star
Last chance, you turn to me
I'd like to let you get to know me
Romance, walk down the street
Do you wanna, do you wanna?
We could turn it on
Somebody told me that the night's done
If I play the right song
We could keep the lights on, baby
(Caught my shootin' star)
Somebody told me there's a full moon
And if I play the right tune
Would you give me all you, baby?
Tell me that your mind's been changin'
I tell you that I'm no good at goodbyes
I could cut a thousand roses
Show you that I'm all torn up inside
You feel safe in sorrow
You feel safe on an open road
Go find yourself or whatever
I wake up hollow
You made me vulnerable
I hope it treats you better than I could do
And I'll wait for you
Tell me that we'll meet up someday
I tell you that I'm no good tellin' lies
Maybe when my heart's done breakin'
Then I could forgive what you tried
You could spend your whole life searchin'
And I could spend the whole day just gettin' by
But every time the red moon rises
I'll stay up and I'll keep some hope inside
I've had one of those bad dreams
Where we're standin' on your street
I quit smokin' those cigarettes
But I'm never gettin' over it
And you're lookin' right through me
Just like Shakespeare wrote a tragedy
But our story, never finished it
'Cause our love, we never finished it
I'm comin' over tonight
Knock on your door just like before
I need that look in your eyes
'Cause we'vе had the loneliest timе 
I'm thinkin' all through the night 
All through the night
I could be yours just like before
I could be yours 
just like before
yours just like before
Rewrite another try
If you wanna try it
If you wanna try me
If you wanna try, love
Baby, leave the light on for me
I've had more of those bad dreams
You were ten feet in front of me
I went running, but I couldn't catch
Just the shadow of your silhouette
Then you spoke the words to me
When you left, I still need to unpack it
Let's save sorry for another night
'Cause this time, love, we're gonna get it right
If you wanna try, love
I just need back into your life
What happened was: we reached the moon
But lost in space, I think we got there all too soon
But lost in space
we got there all too soon
But you know what? I'm comin' back for you, baby
I'm comin' back for you
And in the mornin'
Sun hits the water
Is this nirvana?
I thought love would keep me satisfied
But you know, but you know
I want more than what they advertise
And you're so rational
But you didn't even notice
I was hopin' you would open up 
boy, you got a reputation
I get (I get) anxious
'Cause I need a little head room
a little head room
Slow it down (Slow it down), baby
Could we move it to the bedroom?
I should cool it off, I know you're tired
But you know (But you know)
That I never take my own advice
I was jealous of your company 
I was lookin' for you on the beach
When it's good, why's it always out of reach?
In the hotel, someone sent me flowers
Gettin' dressed now, meet you in an hour
Lavender, sunset, ocean air
Leanin' in, stealin' kisses from your neck
Summer haze, the nights are gettin' hotter
Wake me up when you're ready for the water
Do you think about star signs?
'Cause I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky
No thinkin' over the weekend
My lips havе no secrets
I'm in the spirit for dreamin' 
Holiday, take the chain off the track
The windows were closed, so we kicked the door open
Everyone waved at us
(I tried, but I couldn't get away)
Tried, but I couldn't get away with it
In the water
Ready for the water
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
No thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'
Wake me up when you're ready for the water
I was lookin'
No thinkin'
No limit
Hands touch all night, I remember
I stayed behind and you were tender
In my whole life, I wish I never knew this kind of love
I'm keepin' company
Company with all the friends I got from you
It's not easy to sever
Think you're onto me
Hard to keep it cool, I know you want me too
I'm tryin' to keep away from you
land between our bodies
I can't control the things I do
God, I miss your hands over my body though
Wake up this time, it's now or never
You've made your mind up and I surrender
My heart was blind
I wish I never knew this kind of love
It takes all of my pride
We're gonna need some land between our bodies though
Just one word from you and I'm all out of reasons
Wakin' up, makin' up for the lost time
Close the door, I've been yours for the longest time
Never over, never over
Never over, never, never over
Anything you wanna do
I really wanna do with you
I can be friends with your friends
Anything to be with you
Anything you wanna feel
I really wanna feel with you
I can be down when you're down, you're down
I feel like I know love's second chance almost slipped away
When it comes to me, boy, fallin' for you is never over
Anywhere you wanna go 
I really wanna roll with you
We can make love in your town, my town
And if you wanna dance
I really wanna groove with you 
I'm falllin' for you now, I'm fallin' for you
I can get down when you're down, you're down
Anything, anything, anything, anything
An appetite for stars tonight
And you're the reason
you're the reason 
There's something right in lover's eyes
(Kamikaze)
I saw you in the deep end
A shipwreck underwater
And I know I shouldn't want that
I'm just here for the weekend
A wordless kind of offer
And I'm hopin' that you saw that
'Cause I see you
I fall back into the feelin' like we've just begun
Tell me, Are you tired of bein' alone? 
You're not the only one
I know it sounds fatal, I know we made fires
The ending's real clear and it won't take us higher
Tonight, I might need to come kamikaze
Crash into your way
I love the beginnin', the moonlight is callin'
I know we'll go up, but we'll end up freefallin'
You mind if I need to come kamikaze?
Crash into your way, way, way
You kiss me on the cheek and
We say hello like it's goodbye
I should've called that
But I still feel the heat like
A secret kind of language
When your fingers fall down my back 
I know it sounds fatal
I know we made fires
The ending's real clear 
it won't take us higher
Gravity is not enough to keep me on your street
Walking twenty feet above the ground
I need you to hold my hand
Every kiss we start feels somehow incomplete
Secrets in the corner of your mouth
Things I wanna understand
Then you said, Hey
Before we make a big mistake
Is there some place where we could go right now?
I don't think that it can wait
After last night, things look different 
in the pale moonlight
In the moment, I was hypnotized
You can go ahead and open your eyes
Yeah, I see you and I think it's gonna changе my life
Not afraid of getting close this timе
The consequence of dancin' with these insecurities
Tell me what you want and I'll reply
I can tell the truth
don't lie (Lie, lie)
There's something I need to say
After last night
things look different in the pale moonlight
In the moment
I was hypnotized
After we spent the night
The moon was shining extra bright
We kinda opened up inside
We crossed into the other side
And manifested something bright
It's always been you
Really, always, and it's no surprise
I was nervous, I was hypnotized
Dream slow
I want you to be the one for me, you know
And when the light inside your eyes begins to glow
I won't hold you back from anything you want
I want you to be the one
Speak nice, I had a funeral for us and for my life
If I could be the way you wanted me tonight
But I won't hold you back from anything
I want to give you everything you want
I can see diamonds in the rough
I would fly aeroplanes, an ocean for your touch
Didn't you ever dream of us?
One look in your eyes and it's not me
I would fly aeroplanes
an ocean for your touch
We grow colder, the night's for feeling
the night's for feeling
The fantasy of the way it could have been
So I want you to look inside my head and now see me
With a candle at your table, real peaceful
Too quiet to need anything
We're gonna have to make time
We're gonna have to build each other's lives
We're only earth angels
And every day, I want you
You're pretty, we're drinkin', so I say what I'm thinkin'
How come everybody's dancin' but you?
A deep conversation, a last-minute invitation
Yeah, I'm gonna make this easy for you
But it's like this, I put you on my list
So come downtown if you're around
I hope you do, baby, I insist
I don't care what they say about you
So sick of everybody tellin' me what to do
When all I need is your eyes across the room
Yeah, those eyes across the room
Shy boy, stir me up
Get a little something for your morning cup
You didn't even know you got the Midas touch
Touch, touch, touch, touch
Come pick me up
You show up, you show late
Thе room spins, the earth quakes
I admit that I was waiting for you
My friеnds want to meet you
But they're only gonna tease you
'Cause we made a bet you wouldn't come through
He's got the Midas touch (Stir me up)
Everything he touch turns to gold
Oh, sugar
He's got the Midas touch
Everything he touch turns to gold
You can touch my body
(Stir me up)
Tryin' to paint a picture of the sun with all its flowers
Tryin' to paint a picture of the sun
a picture of the sun with all its flowers
sun with all its flowers
Reachin' closer past the surface
Like I'm slowly gettin' closer to you
Livin' with uncertainty like nothin' really matters
Passed the future on my way to work
And found myself back in bed with you
Give it all some time
Paralyzed devotion
I've been in the dark
Paralyzed in motion
Lost in wintertime
Did I do it to myself?
Hard to know for sure
Did I hurt somebody else?
'Cause you're the one thing
Nothin' really matters
But it matters if it matters to you
It's hard to know for sure
But I believe you're always in my corner
I did it to myself
I did it to you
I can be enchanted by the simple things
Like watch the way the fire's burnin'
All my letters, all the words I tried to forget
Leavin' you was certainly the hardest part of all
But I was livin' like a servant
To a secret I was tryna protect
Don't say I didn’t warn you
I'm something like a shadow
It takes a ghost to know one
And we're so good when we’re in motion
I want to tell you something so hard to say
I think you might already know
I think about you almost every day
There's not a place that you don't go
And in no time
I'll be comin' to you
I'll be flyin' to you
Moon on my shoulder
The architecture of this connection
your reflection is always following me
City to city, heartbeat to heartbeat, Body to body
City to city
heartbeat to heartbeat
Body to body
And I keep contemplating our situation
There's no escaping, your words are following me
You got me, you got me
Light flickers ’cross the ocean
Daydreamin’ on an airplane
I kissed you, it was instinct
Sometimes it's better off to not think
City to city, you got me, you got me
Heartbeat to heartbeat, you got me, you got me
I think all my life, I never met anybody like you
Sunrise all the time when I touch you
It's like I'm wakin' up in a euphoria
My insecurities are things I never was
I was a sad, sad song before we met
But, boy, your love is such a trip
It's like a psychedelic switch
Don't wake me 'cause I'm lucid dreamin'
Meditatin' on your lips
'Cause, baby, I'd be satisfied forever
With a couple years of this
Make me feel like in my birthday suit with you
I'm puttin' on the ritz
I'm in paradise, I never met anybody like you
I don't wanna hide when I'm with you
It's like my whole life now is makin' sense
I'm on the wildest trip and this
You feel just like home
I'm not scared to show you
all my insecurities can't stand the way you look at me
You lovin' me is hard to resist
I'm complimented by your invitation
Did we crash into each other's lives again overnight?
I don't blame you for your hesitation
Will we only make each other cry again?
I get so real when I'm with you
You follow me high, don't follow me low
'Cause on the occasion that one's needin' two
I'm ready to ride wherever you go
I was wrong, I'm still into it
Did I lose your love? When it's physical
Sometimes we get it so right
We can get it so right
I was wrong, no one's innocent
Did we fuck this up? When it's critical
Baby, we can get it so right 
(So right, so right)
Got in trouble with the new location
When you moved into my place, I'm new to someone all the time
After dinner, there was conversation
Dripped in paranoia and it always turned into a fight
But you know the deal when I'm with you
Move closer to me 'cause I know you see through me
Like I want you to read between the lines
Don't say you're sorry and I won't say I'm sorry
Yeah, we don't need the words to make it right
(Did we fuck this up? Did we fuck this up?)
(Move closer to me 'cause I know)
(I want you to read between the lines)
(Don't say you're sorry and I won't)
Close my eyes, I see you
I see you, you, you, you got it
I feel butterflies tryin' hard to escape
Can't deny, there's a feelin' here, you caught it
Makes me wanna try, couple nights, couple days
'Cause you do something to my patience
I can't hardly wait
Come over, come over, I'm ready to see you
Whatever you're schemin', I'm already dreamin'
Come over, come over and don't keep me waitin'
Got nothin' on my mind but the two of us
Come over, come over
After hours, there's a space for you in heaven
Picnic on the floor by a warm fireplace
Up to now, there were tens, but you're eleven
Let me show you how you fit right into place
Fallin' for you is just fine
Baby, don't waste my time
Wanna see you tonight
Faces, lost in time
Like a faded magazine
I've been hard to find
I've been close, but out of reach
When you're next to me
Put it to rest so the rest won't follow me
The ones I loved and left behind
Put it to rest with the rest
Feel some change again
Like your moon won't let mе sleep
Got my way again
Got so close I couldn't breathe
But I never even told you that I only ever wanted you
And I wake up in the morning in the emptiest of empty rooms
Got you on my mind for the second time
Got you on my mind but it's not enough
These are little words, but I'm feeling that
Stadium love, gimme some
Am I the only one who's insatiable?
Waiting for someone who's untouchable
These are little dreams, but I'm wanting that
This is for the weekend lovers
Ones you can't imagine you'll forget
Wishing you a speed recovery
Sliding doors, goodbye
Hеllo, goodbye
On just two nights
One summertimе
Dreams, dreams, dreams
A wish to be broken
So you better hurry up
Yeah, come and pick me up
Hey, boy, saw you on the weekend
Full stop, now I'm in the deep end
Hey, look, now I'm only feeling stadium love
now I'm only feeling stadium love (Watch this)
Come and pick me up
Gimme that stadium love
(Moonlight)
Weekend love
Eyes like invitations
One seat left and you moved over
And it was on
Conversation was more than ordinary
Young girl bought the things you sold her
And on and on
Summertime flies and
We got a little bit older
Got me so high, but
Everybody comes down (Everybody comes down)
Working it out
Alright, guess it was a past life
I haven't seen you around
But it's alright, I'm alright
Soft light hits me on the High Line
So go on foolin' around
I'll be alright, I'm alright
Life goes on
New York, new arrangements
No more sleepin' on your shoulder
I'm movin' on
In the park, there's a Violin beginning Like a movie kind of closure

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke, Well, it's made for me
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head, they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems
You won't remember all my champagne problems
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round
had never seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found
will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me
So we could call it even
I parked my car right between the Methodist
And the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm faking
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I
Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says, I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
(She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it
I wasn't letting up until the day he—
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he died
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividing up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet
But there was happiness because of you
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow
where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness
When we were younger down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for you
this place is the same as it ever was
but you won't like it that way
It's never too late to come back to my side
You know that you'll always know me, Dorothea
you're a queen selling dreams, selling makeup & magazines
from you, I'd buy anything
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skipping the prom
just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be you
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers?
Well, I guess I'll never know
and you'll go on with the show
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me, Dorothea
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh, I can't stop you putting roots in my dreamland
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
Oh, I can't Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, Dancing is a dangerous game
Oh, I thought This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know I'm never gonna love again
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Never wanted love, Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
Actually, I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more
No more keeping score
Now I just keep you warm
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore
Past me, I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind
Never be so kind You forget to be clever
Never be so clever You forget to be kind
I'd think you were talking to me now
Never be so polite
You forget your power
Never wield such power
You forget to be polite
Never be so polite You forget your power
Never wield such power You forget to be polite
I'd think you were listening to me now
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around
It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now
Don't treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears, and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over
Closure, your closure
Your closure, your closure
I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake and it's oh so unnecessary
It cut deep to know you, right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over, I don't need your
Closure, closure, your closure
Your closure
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire
Staring out an open window
Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
Sending signals To be double-crossed
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
That this pain would be for
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?
And when I was shipwrecked
(Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you
(All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light
(Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you
(To be certain we'll be tall again, if you think of all the costs)
It was real enough
(Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore
Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me
I, I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me
You left me, you left me no, you left me no
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me
At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light, everything was just right
I, I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on
Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, What a sad sight
I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
For never leaving well enough alone
I persist and resist
the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding
'Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, How did a middle-class divorcée do it?
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughing, but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holding all this love out here in the hall
I can see you staring, honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seeing you out
So I'm leaving out the side door
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seeing you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out
Didn't even hear me out
All this time
Never learned to read my mind
You never turned things around
I gave so many signs
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
So many times
I never learned to read your mind
So many signs
I couldn't turn things around
'Cause you never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
We gather here, we line up, weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
You hear my stolen lullabies
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces
I want you to know
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure?
Never have I ever before
Your back beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
for the hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
And you wanna scream
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me kid, don't call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, Fuck you forever?
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say move on, but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir, I think he's bleeding out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc, I think she's crashing out
And some things you just can't speak about
With you I serve, with you I fall down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve (With you I serve)
with you I fall down (Down)
Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in)
watch you breathing out (Out)
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James, get in, let's drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinking in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standing with me
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire
Stood on the cliffside screaming, Give me a reason
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes
where all the poets went to die
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be Black and white
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight)
I only see daylight
(And I can still see it all)
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
(I once believed love would be burning red)
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I just think that You are what you love
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from you
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind
But then something happened one magical night
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for you
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are, then one magical night
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate
it's just indifference
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
(Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell them
No rules in breakable heaven
It's a cruel summer With you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said, I'm fine, but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
He looks up, grinning like a devil
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze
a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Take me out, and take me home
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want them all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes you
What's that like?
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads
question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad
(You know that)
'Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
'Cause they see right through me
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
You could stay
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands
I got that, I mean
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive
So where we gonna go?
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go?
He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life
No cameras catch my pageant smile
It's been a long time coming, but
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
That someday we're gonna (Win)
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Paint it blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), just thought you should know
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, She's a bad, bad girl
She's a bad, bad girl
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
that's right, you're the one I want
darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
You're the one I want, one I want
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
My, my, my, my
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
It's death by a thousand cuts
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Trying to find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
Trying to find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, I don't know
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen
faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
But that's not where mine lives
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub
we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
Darling, I fancy you
Boy, I fancy you
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
I, I, I fancy you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you
Soon, you'll get better
You'll get better soon 'Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
We'd still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, Hey, are you okay?
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson
stressing and obsessing about somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
You need to just stop
like can you just not step on my gown?
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign must've taken all night
You just need to take several seats 
and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream 
all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back
Thought I had reason to attack, but no
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say
I'm sorry that I hurt you
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow
I know that I'm a handful, baby
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
I promise that you'll never find another like me
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
you can't spell awesome without me
School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
Wanna hang out? Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents
It's nice to have a friend
Light pink sky, up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand
Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you Babe
Have my back every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I’ve created
I came out alive but I’m black and blue
Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I Had to do
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to
Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan
And I’ll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
And when you're home alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know
Someday you will
Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I've got an I heart question mark
An I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where
I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight
'cause I wanna be everything you need
You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Beautiful eyes
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holding him for ransom, some
Some boys are trying too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta
I see how this is gonna go
Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now
Touch me and you'll never be alone
No one has to know (No one has to know)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play them like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
Now all he thinks about is me
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming
It just felt so good
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly them all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it coming, what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, Don't throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothing
And if he spends my change, then he had it coming
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
[Bridge]
They got their pitchforks
pitchforks & proof, receipts & reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (Light me up)
Light me up
go ahead and light me up
Light me up (Light me up)
I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, She's gone too far this time
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
I get so high
You're loving me
Trip of my life
Every time you're, every time you're touching me
You're touching me
Every time you're, every time you're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
you and me, we got big reputations
And you heard about me,
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
you and me would be a big conversation
And I heard about you
You like the bad ones, too
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whipping a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me
I'm one call away whenever you need me
I'm in a G5, come to the A-Side
I got a bad boy persona
that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too
'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna be Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't trying to play
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game
I don't wanna touch you
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I hit you like bang
we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put them
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go
your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor
it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
You must like me for me
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
Yeah, I want you
We can't make Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice
Look what you made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast
The world moves on
another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me,
all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on
but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody
and nobody trusts me
I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!
See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
You make everyone disappear
and Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Tripping when you're gone
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skipping, skip-skipping when I'm gone
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes…
I did a number on you
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting? (One, two, three)
Come here, dressed in black now
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
(I hate you so much)
Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
Honey, it hurts
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats alone
Unless you wanna come along?
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
You were driving the getaway car
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
While he was running after us, I was screaming
Go, go, go
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me
Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
I was riding in a getaway car
Riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on calling me Baby like trying on clothes
Salute to me, I'm your American queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart,
body and soul,
And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
And all at once, you are the one, I have been waiting
Body and soul
Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
Your love is a secret
hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury
Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough
And all at once
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah
we love without reason
First sight, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know?
And My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know?
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
Like it was the first time, first time
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance?
Oh, through an avalanche?
And Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
'cause it's gravity keeping you with me
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)
Hands tied, hands tied
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Take it off
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
pining and desperately waiting
All of this silence and patience
pining and desperately waiting
pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from all this
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
There is an indentation in the shape of you
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night
Call it what you want
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?
Yes (Would you run away?)
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want
Call it what you want to
Call it what you want, call it
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady
This is why we can't have
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face
Nice things, honey
You and me from the night before
but Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turning away
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
Hold on to the memories
they will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
We're all here, the lights and boys are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, He can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey, most of them are true
I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
Please take my hand and Please take me dancing
Please leave me stranded, It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
a castle Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said Welcome to New York
it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything
Nice to meet you, where you been?
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God, who is she?
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Midnight, You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave
'cause I Know exactly where it leads
but I Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat
I say, I heard that you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl
He says, What you heard is true
but I Can't stop thinking 'bout you
and I said, I've been there too a few times
A tight little skirt
Take me home
Just take me home
Out of style
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?
Looking at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was Stay
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
That's what people say
Can't stop, won't stop moving
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don’t see
That's what they don’t see
I'm dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go
And that's what they don't know
That’s what they don’t know
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it’s gonna be alright
'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, Oh my God, but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around
2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold
So take a look what you've done
And baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
He said, Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds
I thought, Heaven can't help me now
But this is gonna take me down
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Even if it's just in your Wildest dreams
I said, No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow you around
(Follow you around)
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Pretend, just pretend
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, Are you insane?
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want
And then, you say
That's how you get the girl, girl
Remind her how it used to be, be
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And you know
That I don't want you to go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me
And then you say
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
These hands had to let it go free, and
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time
and This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
I know places, I know places
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
And you know for me, it's always you
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
And I know for you, it's always me
It was months and months of back and forth
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Flashing lights, and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
I should have slept with one eye open at night
And we pretended it could last forever
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'
I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland
We both went mad
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland
One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, Look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence
Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night, he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says You're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
We're burning red
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous (And I like it)
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you
follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This slope is treacherous
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
'Til you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Knew it right there
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
but I'm feeling 22
if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
if we just keep dancing like we're 22
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if We just keep dancing
like we're 22
I don't know about you
We ditch the whole scene
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long hard week
I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, This is it, I've had enough, 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
We called it off again last night, but
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, Never say never
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, Okay, let's talk
And I said
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you, for my whole life
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Find myself at your door
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you
the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darling, it was good
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, I need you
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
For all that we've been through
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had a beautiful magic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me
'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic,
beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen
Like diamonds in the sky
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now
‘Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
I said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
starlight
He said, Look at you
Worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
Like, Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
he's talking crazy
dancing with me
we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that Baby, I'm right here smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here
As I'm looking around the room
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said he'd be here
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing)
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
You called me later
And said, I'm sorry I didn't make it
And I said, I'm sorry, too
And that was the moment I knew
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
I don't wanna need you this way
come back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I guess you're in London today
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
And everybody knows that
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding & right
It's kinda like a code
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts
I say, Can you believe it?
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, I'll never leave you alone.
You said, I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
I can see it now (See it now)
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard from the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would
I run my fingers through your hair
and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
And I'd go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
turn around & make it alright
I'd go back to December
turn around & change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you)
Don't say yes, run away now
Your time is running out
And they said speak now
Say a single vow
I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, speak now
And you say
Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
Speak now
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes & trying to look busy
trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
the way that you dance around in your pj's
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, Have we met?
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
This night is sparkling
Blushing all the way home
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known for the things that she does On the mattress
the things that she does On the mattress
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
she thinks I'm psycho
rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
'Cause I don't think you do
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
So much better
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead
holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
You're all I wanted
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now I'll go sit on the floor
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And I'll go sit on the floor
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh
So I'll watch your life in pictures
like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, This is absurd
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live all the mountains we moved
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment?
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
snide remarks from my father
about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking ‘bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
If you're out there
if you're somewhere
if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say, Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Thought you'd be here by now
Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say
And you smile and say, How are you?”
I say, Just fine
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
hope someday you'll take me away & save the day
Something in his deep brown eyes has me saying
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
Come back, I'll be with you someday
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
I remember tears streaming down your face
when I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Don't you dare look out your window
darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the music's gone
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light
you and I'll be safe and sound
Just close your eyes, you'll be alright
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
superstar
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile
and all the girls in the front row Scream your name
You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, This time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me
I said, Leave, but all I really want is you
And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it
What I mean is
I said, Leave, but baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, I'm in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
But you're just so cool
run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
So, baby, drive slow
'til we run out of road
in this one horse town
So, baby, drive slow  'til we run out of road
run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know, I haven't seen you around before.
feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried
when you're fifteen & somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath, as you walk through the doors
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, Hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, Please don't go,
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, Please don't go,
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say Yes
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?
I can't help it if you look like an angel
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Can't help myself
I can't help myself
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
To come around
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Try and catch me now
It's too late to catch me now
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe You belong with me?
You belong with me
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And here's to you and your temper
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby
but I've figured you out
baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
Don't wanna hurt anymore
You had me crawling for you, honey
and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming & fighting & kissing in the rain
You're so in love that you acted insane
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
now you're halfway out the door
it rains in your bedroom
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight
grab the keys
And we drive and drive
until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
until I've forgotten all their names
laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
the best day with you today
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
grew up in a pretty house and had space to run
age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now
finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
These walls that they put up to hold us back
will fall down
walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah
we'll sing hallelujah
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
So I'mma stay through it all
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway
But you're untouchable
burning brighter than the sun
Come on, come on
I'm caught up in you
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name
And I know all the steps up to your door
Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start
Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear
I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say
But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of getting stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
September saw a month of tears
And thanking God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And looking back on all of that, it's nice to believe
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standing on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, That's a lie
State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself
more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
all my wasted time
And if you're missing me
you'd better keep it to yourself
And if you're missing me you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
bad for your health
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
you're just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
wishing on a wishing star
I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I d
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do
and that's all I know
I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery
But that's okay
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, but life goes on
just a girl
trying to find a place in this world
Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly
oh but life goes on
that's all I know
a place in this world
Oh, I'm just a girl
You have a way of coming easily to me
coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
And when you take
you take the very best of me
So I start a fight
need to feel something
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
what you wanted
what a shame
what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away
no use defending words that you will never say
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
You put up walls
paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
You never did give a damn thing, honey
but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
if I died, died for you
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you
I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason, I know
I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?
You saw me there, but never knew
I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late so you see
You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too
Late to do anything
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, 'cause I know you
I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on
Baby, you're losing it
The water's high
You're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry
But you don't tell anyone
That you might
Not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby
Corey's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as he's walking home, saying, Does he know?
Will you ever know?
Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation when he's taking my breath away
I should say
Hey, by the way
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Stay beautiful
If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know
You're beautiful
Every little piece, love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, Yes
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
You should've said, No
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, Why?
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, Oh my my my
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, Oh my my my
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck, and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, I do, and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I
I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, Baby, is something wrong?
I say, Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song
And he says
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my loving bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
The other half I'm only trying to let you know
let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
Just a small town boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
When I'm with anybody else it's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just wanna show you
We could be a beautiful Miracle, Unbelievable
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle, Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Maybe I should've seen the signs
Should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but
break a perfectly good heart
take our love and tear it all apart now
make the very first scar?
It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?
When your dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again, 
friends Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
Time slows down whenever you're around
Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
All that I can say Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
it's how it used to be
you can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
it's been spent and traded in
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me
I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
The best and worst day of June was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your, Don't you wish you had me? grin
Well I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
no amount of freedom gets you clean
Mister Perfect face
Mister Here to stay
Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
I've been waiting for you all my life
Every single day until the end, I will be by your side
But that was when I got to know mister Change of heart
Leaves me all alone, I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay
Hello, mister Perfectly fine
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Always at the right place at the right time
Hello, mister Casually cruel
Everything revolves around you
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're mister Perfectly fine
Never told me why
Never had to see me cry
Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
I thought you might be different than the rest
I guess you're all the same
I hear he's got his arm around a brand-new girl
I've been picking up my heart, he's been picking up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mister Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
I was Miss Here to stay
Now I'm Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be mister Too late
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
back when I deserved it
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy
When it was good, it was good
We showed them all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking about your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
We used to watch the sun 
go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy
I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices 
and that's what these tears are for
We were happy
And you were gonna marry me
You said, I know
When I said, I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
You watched me go
And I knew my Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, When can I come back?
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when I see your face
I'll let you in and that's when
I said, I know
When you said, I did you wrong
Made mistakes and put you through all of this
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, Leave those all in our past
And you said, When can I come back?
Honestly When you were gone, Did you ever think of me?
Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothing like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy
But don't you, don't you
Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you Smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've Missed me 
if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?
Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just something I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this
So I walk out of here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say we're still friends
(But I don't wanna pretend)
So if I see you again
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
down to my skin
I'm driving away and I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I still love you but I can't
Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
The picture frame is empty On the dresser
vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends
you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
I love you to the moon and back
to the moon and back
I know I'm probably better off on my own
didn't know what he had when he had it
the permanent damage you did to me
Never again
wish I could forget when it was magic
wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
the bravest thing I ever did
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
Sometimes, in the middle of the night
I can feel you again
wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
I know I’m probably better off all alone
could change his mind
At any given minute
it was always on your terms
waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
you never thought I'd run
I hold onto this pride 
these days it's all I have
I gave to you my best 
we both know you can't say that
I wonder what we would've become
We might still be in love
You would've been the one
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
They tell you while you're young
girls, go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay 
the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
She looks like she's been through it
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
know everything at eighteen But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me 
when I'm nothing new
How long will it be cute
all this crying in my room
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time until I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room?
People love an ingénue 
I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
What about your promises?
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away
Big mistake
you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
the sweetest promise That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, No one else
How could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe 
(This is the last time, this is the last time)
What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
you're the wrecking ball
We said, No one else
Since you admitted it
Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
Her lips on your neck
I hate that because of you I can't love you
I know that you like me
frightening, standing here waiting
hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
But now you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified
you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here, hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster
replaying your laughter, disaster
How is it in London?
Where were you while I'm wondering
If I'll ever see you again
You could be the one that I love
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me
tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
they let me sit in back when we were in love
they sit around talking about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved them 
that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, it wasn't a mansion
Just living room dancing and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say
you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
Mister superior Thinking
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud
Why did you let her go?
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're looking for
the love that you had?
Now you're out in the world
searching for your soul
Scared not to be hip
scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status
last time you felt free
none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
think about me when you're out
your cool indie music concerts every week
think about me in your house
your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me
she wrote a song about me
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
getting pulled down by gravity
Just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, It's not just a phase I'm in
My voice comes out begging
All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
pull at every thread 
every thread 
solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest 
and Please don't go
Give me the keys
I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no
There's a chain around your throat
piece of paper where I wrote
I'll wait for you
There's a key on the chain
there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you
And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
we'll run
So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no
And the note from the locket
you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let them tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run 
And we run, and we run, and we run
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
And so it goes
Every weekend, the same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you
And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in L.A
Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you
Take me away
To you, to you
Take me away
And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck the patriarchy Keychain on the ground
we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down
Any time now He's gonna say it's love
you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame 
you held my lifeless frame
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
Sacred prayer
They say all's well that ends well
but I'm in a new hell Every time 
you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
you, That's what happened, you
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
watch the front door all night, willing you to come
It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one
Never good at telling jokes
but the punch line goes
but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
(Just between us)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
I was there, I was there
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the morning with someone
But feeling alone
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneaking out into town
Holding hands, just killing time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
All of the girls you loved before
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town
Crying in the bathroom for some dude Whose name I cannot remember now
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild 
Breaking up, making up
Leave without saying goodbye
And just know that It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
It's why you're so amazing
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels
But I love you more
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open
The tricky thing Is yesterday, we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, Winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleepin', sleepin'
So here you are
Two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around 
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown 
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay
Carolina knows why, for years, I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here
And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me, the sand, and the sea
Carolina knows
Meet me at midnight
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me
I feel The lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me 
(All they keep asking me) Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see Is a one-night or a wife
(Only kinda girl they see)
I find it dizzying
They're bringing up my history 
But you weren't even listening
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk 
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave
It was maroon
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
And life will lose all its meaning (For the last time)
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
She's laughing up at us from Hell
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fucking beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's coming down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched "aurora borealis green"
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true
Now it's like snow at the beach
I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
Are we falling like snow at the beach?
(It's coming down, it's coming down)
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid
Yeah, you can face this
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
I remember
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Fucking situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night?
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fucking politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressing for revenge
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
She don't dress for friends
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines and crossing all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm going out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world, have you heard? 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you, but I miss sparkling
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? A diamond's gotta shine
A diamond's gotta shine
And we're dancing all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last
Uh-oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)
'Cause karma is the thunder Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen Coming straight home to me
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
They said the end is coming
Everyone’s up to something
I find myself running home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care
My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down, took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it
It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back
To that bloodshed, crimson clover
the worst was over
we're burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
I vow I will always be yours
No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?
Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe
Lock broken, slur spoken
Wound open, game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking, blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
Storm coming, good husband, Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely, good money
I'd pay if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
(You should find another)
Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss
So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire
You should find another guiding light
But I shine so bright
You say, I don't understand, and I say, I know you don't
We thought a cure would come through in time
now, I fear it won't
Remember looking at this room? 
We loved it 'cause of the light
Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always rising from the ashes
Mending all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losing me
Every morning I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dying?
I sent you signals 
and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray
but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
You don't know what you got until it's gone
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losing me)
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army
frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinking
Do something, babe, say something
(Say something)
Lose something, babe, risk something
Choose something, babe, I got nothing
(I got nothing)
To believe, unless you're choosing me
I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walking on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
('Cause it's you)
I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleeding
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away
Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hanging out with you tonight
I've got my money on things going badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feeling your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch
I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm trying hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart
I've gotten used to no one calling my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleeping alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seeing it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I can see you, do you?
I’ve been watching you for ages
And I spend my time trying not to feel it
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?
’Cause I can see you waiting down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed
it's something I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet
I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, Meet me tonight
Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself
Once, I had an empire
Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screaming at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me
My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
And the voices say, You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson
Foolish one
Stop checking your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
You know how to keep me waiting
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinking you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every morning while you're watching the news
Now I'm sliding down the wall with my head in my hands
Saying, How could I not see the signs?
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screaming in the silence
And the voices in my head are telling me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
You will learn the hard way instead of just walking out
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughing on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be coming home all right
And you would've been fine
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holding hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like something in this old shop
I thought about it as I started looking around
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, "Hello"
In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turning gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
Even if we'd met on a crowded street
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimming pool
What if all I need is you?
Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you’ll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't
But if I’m all dressed up
They might as well be looking at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love
Send the code, he's waiting there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pulling me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman
Half asleep
Takin’ your time in the tangerine
Neon light, this is luxury
You're not saying you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake
Taking your chance, it's a big mistake
I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to
And if they call me a (Slut)
I've known it from the very start
We’re a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop
I’m standing on a tightrope alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holding out hope for you to
Say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why’d you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why’d you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
(Say) Say, "(Don't) don’t (Go) go"
Now I'm pacing on shaky ground
Strike a match, then you blow it out
Oh no, oh no, it's not fair
'Cause you kiss mе and it stops time
And I'm yours, but you're not mine
Oh no, oh no, you're not there
I'm standing on the sidewalk alone
I wait for you to drive by
I'm trying to see the cards that you won't show
I'm about to fold unless you
Why'd you have to make me want you? 
Why'd you have to give me nothing back?
Why'd you have to make me love you?
I said, "I love you"
You say nothing back
You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk
You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways
You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself, the morе I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost, now that we don't talk
What do you tell your friends we Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's Platonic, 
it's just ended, so
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest 
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left 
(Until I left)
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk
You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turning out my empty pockets
And when it came to you
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walking in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined
You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
That my life would be ruined
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Once the flight had flown 
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
Whеn you lost control 
Red blood, white snow 
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her 
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every model's bed for something greater, baby
(Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it? Was it?)
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the morning with someone
But feeling alone
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneaking out into town
Holding hands, just killing time
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you the way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
All of the girls you loved before
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need
I'm so thankful for all of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town
Crying in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild
Breaking up, making up
Leave without saying goodbye
And just know that it's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
It's why you're so amazing
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels
Like the girls you loved before
Every dead-end street
led you straight to me
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
Thought of calling, but you won't pick up
Another fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, Who uses typewriters anyway?
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots
And who's gonna hold you like me?
Nobody, No-fucking-body, Nobody
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you
Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile
But you should've seen him when he first got me
My boy only breaks his favorite toys
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time
There was a litany of reasons why we could've playеd for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
I'll tell you that he runs because he loves me 
Once I fix me he's gonna miss me
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off, but I'm not
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love
Now I'm down bad, crying at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
Fuck it if I can't have him
I might just die, it would make no difference
Down bad, waking up in blood
Staring at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you
For a moment, I was heavenstruck
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Waving at the ship)
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
Pulled him in tighter each time he was drifting away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill
Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
I stopped trying to make him laugh
stopped trying to drill the safe
Thinking, How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?"
Oh, the tragedy
So long, London
You'll find someone
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
I founded the club she's heard great things about
I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
For so long, London
Stitches undone
Two graves, one gun
I'll find someone
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment
And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there
So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go before I'd self-implode?
Before I'd have to go be free?
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
I died on the altar waiting for the proof
You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
And I'm just getting color back into my face
I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutching their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted
Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, But Daddy, I love him
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means
Not growing up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall
Stay away from her!
The saboteurs protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screeching tires and true love
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinking it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
There's a lot of people in town that I bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holding out, but fuck 'em, it's over
Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
Now, pretty baby, I'm running back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
Another summer taking cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again
My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me going
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
Now, pretty baby, I'm running
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings
You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share down in Destin
Florida is one hell of a drug
Florida, can I use you up?
The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
Little did you know your home's really only
The town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away just to wait out
The shitstorm back in Texas
I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
It's one hell of a drug
Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
So take me to Florida
your home's really only a town you're just a guest in
Drowning in the Blue Nile
He sent me "Downtown Lights"
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of cracking locks
Throwing my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?
What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touching his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk"
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, taking all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Building up like waves crashing over my grave
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously
The who's who of Who's that? is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about sad
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
Who's afraid of little old me?
You should be
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singing along
You caged me and then you called me crazy
I am what I am 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town
The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud
They shake their heads saying
God, help her
When I tell 'em he's my man
But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can
The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway
His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face
And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set
He had a halo of the highest gradе
He just hadn't met me yеt
Good boy, that's right, come close
I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No, really, I can
Maybe I can't
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, We were just kids, babe
I said, I don't mind, it takes time
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
You Holy Ghost
You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times
Who's gonna tell me the truth 
when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since
What we thought was for all time was momentary
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You shit-talked me under the table
Talking rings and talking cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed?
That I can't get out of bed
'something counterfeit's dead
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
I'll never leave - never mind
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life
I can read your mind
She's having the time of her life
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it, and I did
Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, More!
All the piеces of me shatterеd
as the crowd was chanting, More!
I was grinning like I'm winning
I was hitting my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
I can hold my breath
I've been doing it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her likе an also-ran
You didn't measure up in any measurе of a man
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writing a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, Good riddance
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut them from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
That child's play back in school is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
'Cause the sign on your heart said it's still reserved for me
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer sticking to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league
Where's the trophy? He just comes running over to me
You look like Clara Bow
In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know
You'd be picked like a rose
I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan
This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling
You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshine, a full еclipse
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
They all wanna say
The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new god we're worshipping
Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
Demanding more
Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
Do they let you know
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
You look like Taylor Swift
In this light, we're loving it
You've got edge, she never did
I am someone who until recent events you shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays "The Starting Line"
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming
I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up thе way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a bravе man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body was shaking, do you hate me?
Was it hazing for a cruel fraternity
I pledged and I still mean it
Six weeks of breathing clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you making fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it
And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leaving
I still can't believe it
Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
Did your research, you knew the price going in
And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm going in
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or gonna smash up your bike
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back
Whether I'm gonna curse you out or take you back to my house
I hear thе whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine (You're mine)
Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end
Whether I'm gonna flip you off or pull you into the closet
I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becoming something new
Say you got somebody, I'll say I got someone too
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leaving here with you
Bygones will be bygone, eras fading into gray
We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game
Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way
Wise men once said
Wild winds are death to the candle
A rose by any other name is a scandal
Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you
One bad seed kills the garden
One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger
She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger
And when that sky rains fire on you
And you're persona non grata
I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters
Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it
Jackals raised their hackles
You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly
When they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them
So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue
The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger
(This terrible danger)
Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, I loved you the way that you were
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered
You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time back to the moment
I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth to know what to do
So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
Like it never happened?
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
It just didn't happen
Say you loved me
Say you'll always wonder
'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?
We hereby conduct this post-mortem
He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them
And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign
Come one, come all, it's happening again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know, how did it end?
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
And fell victim to interlopers' glances
Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
Then feverishly calling their cousins
Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off
One gasp and then
How did it end?
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming
Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G
It's happening again
I can't pretend like I understand
But I still don't know
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
And in a blink of a crinkling eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me about the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smoking your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
I'm watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm trying to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)
It's just a game, but really
I'm betting on all three for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet? 
Then pull me to thе back seat
No onе's ever had me, not like you
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
You already know, babe
I feel like laughing in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman
Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see, I was a debutante in another life
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what
secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here
We wished we could live in instead of this
And getting married off for the highest bid
Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick
If I'd been there, I'd hate it
It was freezing in the palace
lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet
only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark
the night I felt like I might die
I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life 
and I'll get lost on purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity
the current flies through me
And in my fantasies, I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say
All that time you were throwing punches
I was building somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
And it wasn't a fair fight
a clean kill each time
stompеd across my grave
And then she wrotе headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
But I prayed that one day I could say
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singing
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you
Screamed to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I had died the tiniest death
I spied the catch in your breath
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Northbound I got carried away
As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing
I look in people's windows
Transfixed by rose golden glows
They have their friends over to drink nice wine
In case you're at their table
What if your eyes looked up and met mine one more time?
You had stopped and tiltеd your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I triеd searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the if only
Like I'm some deranged weirdo
I attend Christmas parties from outside
What if your eyes looked up and met mine one more time?
Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten
Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home
I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said
Please, I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to about if they can redo the prophеcy?
Cards on the table
Mine play out likе fools in a fable
Oh, it was sinking in
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him
And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
A greater woman stays cool
But I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
But I looked to the sky and said, Please
I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call
When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
When the truth comes out, it's quiet
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?
I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
What doesn't kill you makes you aware
What happens if it becomes who you are?
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothing like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all
No one heard, not a single word was heard
It's so quiet
Forgive me, Peter
My lost fearless leader
In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids
Is it something I did?
The goddess of timing
Once found us beguiling
She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did
And I didn't wanna come down
I thought it was just goodbye for now
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep but never to keep
never to keep
Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do
Underneath the same moon
In different galaxies
And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the Lost Boys chapter of your life
Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on to the days when you were mine
the woman who sits by the window 
turned out the light
Promises oceans deep
By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made a curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her The Bolter
Started with a kiss
Oh, we must stop meeting like this
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing
All her fucking lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive
He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it's all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows she must bolt
She's been many places
With men of many faces
First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawing aces
But none of it is changin'
That the chariot is waitin'
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping
Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
Long may you reign
You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense
You have no idea
Strings tied to levers
Slowed-down clocks tethered
All this showmanship
To keep it for you in sweetness
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter For you
Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs
You're a just ruler
Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea
Buried down deep
And out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you in sweetness
Wilder and lighter
You got the dragonflies above your bed
You have a favorite spot on the swing set
You have no room in your dreams for regrets
(You have no idea)
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
But now we'll curtail your curiosity 
In sweetness
Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair
They compared their licenses
He said, I'm not a donor 
but I'd give you my heart if you needed it
She rolled her eyes and said
You're a professional
No, just a good samaritan
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushing strollers
But, soon, it was over
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press
Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors
She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure
And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know
Looking backwards might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for
The only thing that's left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
Now and then, I reread the manuscript
But the story isn't mine anymore

Happy came to visit me
he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea & he told me it'll all be okay
Well, I told him I'd do anything
to have him stay with me
So he laid me down
and I felt Happy come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy
Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble
one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
I was in the bathroom
I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, again I have to clean
I sighed and mumbled to myself
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you
in the night I'll see you
Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life
And when he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure
'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would start to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first time
In the rearview mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it
So come inside and be with me
Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name
Atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
One morning this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work and you won't see a change
Save perhaps a slight gray in my eye
I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why
I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home
And then one warm summer night
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds
Don't wait for me, I can't come
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl
You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side
Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I wanna feel it
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I cum
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs
Did you get that?
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world
Would you kill me, Jerusalem?
Come find me
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me
That shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying, Take it all, please
And tell me no
Tell me no"
Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad
Somebody, please
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Holding hands under a table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
You only love me when we're all alone
Down empty streets sniffing glue me and you
Blank open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long hard twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void
Went to your room thinking maybe you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
But you know that you're needing it
But you know that you want it
Yeah you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad
With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Today I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all
So today I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things
I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all
Or at least take my picture
Before I fall apart
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end
About to fall
How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me
You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose
Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you
But how long, how long can we play this way?
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules
Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin?
It cries a soft weep like mine
I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price?
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?
'Cause I want
One, two
Honey, what'd you take?
I think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by
I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down
But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die
Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man
Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say "I can take that!"
Oh, you are my little boy
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl, you're looking good"
Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man
Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good
But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it
You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am alone
I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from
I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown
So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear
I am hungry, I have been hungry, I was born hungry
What do I need?
I am something, I have been something, I was born something
What could I be?
There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep
I am waiting, I have been waiting, I was born waiting
I was born waiting For that something
Just to want something
I was born something, I was born
There is a light, I feel it in me
But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me
To awake in the night, crying "Set me free"
And I awake every night, crying "Set me free"
I'm all used up, pretty boy
Over and over again, my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy
What do they tell you?
'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones
I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first, open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone
Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?
And I can take a little bit more
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?
Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it love
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder
Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
There's nobody better than you
It took me a while till I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?
It just took me a while till I knew
Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart till it grew
You just grew a little smarter too
So I don't blame you if you want to
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be
There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart
Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart till it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you
And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am
And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be?
I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and
Not the way I used to be
'Cause there's nobody better than you
And right outside the door nobody knows
I never was very good
I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good
And I don't need anything other than you
I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes
So darling, play your violin
I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh, baby
Don't say sorry
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you
Just play your violin
We will manage somehow
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need
I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw
I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms
I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch
Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew
And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew
You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away
I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach
I didn't mind, I adored him, so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown
And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
There's a lie that I told to you
I hold one card That I can't use
But I want you
I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor
You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you, darling
And I am done, dear
You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you
I want you
Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept
I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine
I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground
Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me
I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn
Silly me, waiting
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached
I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city, and I don't need proof
All I need, darling is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft, and I ache
Reach out the car window trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So I follow the white lines, follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too
Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue
Mom, am I still young?
Can I dream for a few months more?
It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape
Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you
You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full
And nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight, the boys are gonna go
Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on
For more, more, more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but
When, when, when?
I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be
The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child
So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sōde
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me "Don't", so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM
On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything
I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me
I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
So if you need to be mean
I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good
If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart
It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go
He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh, I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet
So take me out, baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out, baby
I will retire to the Salton Sea
At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money
And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here
So stay with me
And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you
'Cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you
And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end
Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave
And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars
I drive when it rains
At night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the Styx
So black it shines
And carry me out
Carry me out
At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night
All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts, like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night, carefully
I was going to live
You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine, you were looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night, quietly
It was told to believe
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come
Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real
it's not real enough
But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you
I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So Why didn't you stop me?
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?
I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you
Look how I remember
Paint it over
We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday
if You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little
Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about
Nobody told me it ended
Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch
There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill
It's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow
I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something
Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say "Hello"
And I lose
'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me
In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?
I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show
'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
To finally call it heaven?
I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me
I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven
I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me
But me and my husband
And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better
Come into the water
Do you wanna be my baby?
Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water
Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?
I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me
My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?
And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me
And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no
I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
I love you, I love you, I love you
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?
A lake with no fish
Is the heart of a horse
Named Cold Air
Who, when young
Would run like a storm
They would say
I thought I'd traveled a long way
But I had circled
The same old sin
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
But do mi ti
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night
Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light?
Are you?
Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
But as it is and it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony
I wanna be just like the sky
just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place
Just fly so far away to another place
To be away from all
To be one
Of everything
To be one of everything
I wanna be just like the wind
just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space
I wanna be just like the sea
just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease
Let's step carefully into the dark
carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight?
Who will I become tonight?
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire
Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally
Float off of me
And maybe they'll finally float off of me
I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things, too
But I'm working for the knife
I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys
I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife
I used to think I'd be done by twenty
Now at twenty-nine, the road ahead appears the same
the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at thirty
Though maybe at thirty, I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife
I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right, but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife
Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye
It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where you need to go
To where the dark remembers you
Open up your heart
Like the gates of Hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight
Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker
Everyone, all of them
Everyone said, Don't go that way
So, of course, to that, I said
I think I'll go that way
And I left the door open to the dark
I said, Come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet
Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said, Take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again
Heat lightning
Heat lightning running outside the window
I've laid awake since one and now it's four o'clock
Though I've held on, can't carry it much longer
can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone
And there's nothing I can do, not much I can change
So I give it up to you, I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do, not much I can change
I give it up to you, I surrender
Heat lightning, watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky flutters in a dream
Well, I've held on, but feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones
Can I give it up to you? Would that be okay?
If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching
(I apologize) (You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl
I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
to keep me here
Something else to keep me
Here's my hand, There's the itch
Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out
How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to
Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow
There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you
You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you
Give her all the love
You saved for it
You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life
And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you
But you're the only one
She's counting on
Well, I went through my list of friends 
and found I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity
When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went to hold me
the lengths you went to hold me
To get to have me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me, but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I'm sorry, it should've been me
I'd be going about my day
until a hand would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while
When I saw the girl looked just like me
Must be lonely loving someone Trying to find their way out of a maze
I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn to be somebody else
It’s been you and me since before I was me
Without you, I don't yet know quite how to live
If I could keep anything of you
I would keep just this quiet after you
It's still as a pond I am staring into
From here, I can say, Thank you
From here, I can tell you, Thank you
We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to
That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
There's a bug like an angel stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older, I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes, a drink feels like family
Hey, what's the matter? Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when ya break them, they break you right back
Amateur mistake, you can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back
When I'm bent over wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember the wrath of the devil Was also given him by God
Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm suckin' up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zoomin' through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burnin' something, kids feelin' alive
Freight train stampedin' through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced
I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin' face
Freight train horn howlin' out mad and wild
Headin' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced
All of our love
Filling all of our room
Your low, warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven
Now I bend like a willow
Thinkin' of you
Like a murmuring brook
Curving about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you
Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is runnin’ through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We havе for the day
Can we stay awhile and listеn for Heaven
I don't like my mind
I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake
A whole cake, all for me
And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
And it may be a few years
but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room with the things that I've done
so please don't take Take this job from me
There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such a walk and I found that I'd said
I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it, I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul?
Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watchin' mе
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said
Now I'm taken, thе night has me
You won't hear me singin', you're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free
For now I'm taken, the night has me
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal
When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Drippin' through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark
And if I break
Could I go on break?
Be back in my room
Writin' speeches in my head
Listenin' to the thousand hands
That clap for me in the dark
Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?
'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine
My baby here on Earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?
Nothing in the world is mine for free
The frost, it looks like dust settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten, the only one left
Now the world is mine alone
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window
This morning after you're gone
And the house is mine alone
You're my best friend, now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see
It's just witness-less me
Remember when we met?
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it
That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shinin'
It's traveled very far
I'll Keep a leftover light
Burnin' so you can keep lookin' up
Isn't that worth holdin' on?
You know I'd always been alone
'Til you taught me
To live for somebody
I'm yours no matter That love's gone
We just see it shinin'
We've travеled very far
Keep a leftovеr light
You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a god
I destroy you like I am
I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No one will ever love me like you again
So, when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I?
I can feel it gettin' near
Like flashlights comin' down the way
One day, you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgment by the hounds
People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a god
I betray you like a man
Brushin' my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughin' in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down
How I love me after you
King of all the land
Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the
Curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own
How I love me after you
I'm king of all the land

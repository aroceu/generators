    <h1>aroceu's prompt generators: info</h1>

    <div id="text"><p>These generators are made for free use. Prompts are inspiration for fic, art, roleplay, and any other creative purpose, transformative or otherwise.  All basic and fandom prompt generators grab from approximately the same pool of prompts (when applicable), particularly the tropes, common careers, and common NSFW elements. Most prompts, however, tend to be more SFW.</p>

      <p>Lyric generators will be updated eventually.</p>

<p>All generators are mobile-compatible for accessibility. They are written in PHP and hardcoded by me.</p>

<p>Credit is not required, but linking back is appreciated. </p>

      <p>If you need to contact me for any reason, you can reach me via <a href="https://aroceu.com">any method of your choosing</a>.</p>
